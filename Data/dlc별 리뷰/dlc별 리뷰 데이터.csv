0,Seasons 리뷰,"This DLC is amazing however it should not be bought full price because you should not have to pay for weather and events in the first place. But if you are looking to add a more realistic game play to your game i DO recommend this pack one of my favorites and would buy again. Very worth it when it is on sale the $40 full price is outrageous but it comes on sale fairly often (every few months) if you are looking into buying it that is the best times to get it. hope this helped debate your opinion :,)",Recommended
1,Seasons 리뷰,"This is one of those DLCs that is necessary to make your game fun. However, EA said in the beginning that they would keep adding seasons to new worlds and guess what? The new worlds for the newest DLCs don't have any weather. Life and Death suffers particularly much with this - it doesn't even rain there and you can forget about snow. Typical EA.",Not Recommended
2,Seasons 리뷰,"This pack is so cool! I love that you can do things like, celebrate Christmas, or Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa even! It makes it more like how most people are. Celebrating holiday(s), shoveling snow, and etc! It's so satisfying! 5-star!!",Recommended

6,Seasons 리뷰,"This Sims 4 DLC is recommended for seasons fans. It can be Summer, Spring, Autumn and Winter in game depending the time in game. My favourite season would be Spring because there be beautiful plants & flowers in game.",Recommended
7,Seasons 리뷰,Its good BUT you shouldnt have to pay 50$-ish for WEATHER. also it doesn't come with a world like all the other expansion packs.,Recommended
8,Seasons 리뷰,The way this still isn't base game is crazy. With how much DLC and packs TS4 has EA could at least be generous with not only making this free (just like base game itself) but also coming back to entirely rework the code for seasons to make it even better,Not Recommended
9,Seasons 리뷰,"Frankly, it's slightly below The Sims 3's Seasons DLC, but it's still a good variation on gameplay nonetheless. Being able to create your own holidays, in addition to minor holidays like watch parties and the lottery is a fun addition, plus I enjoy how they leaned into expanding upon snowflake day. Instead of hot tubs you get kiddie pools, and as far as my knowledge goes the parks in your town don't change for holidays. Nonetheless, it's a fun DLC to somewhat spice up your gameplay, but I would recommend getting it on a sale.",Recommended

15,Seasons 리뷰,"Just bought the "" Everyday Sims Bundle"". Honstly worth it.

For anyone who want to play this game, it is better to add atleast the seassons pack or City living pack because it will add alot of things to the game.

And for all those negative revews just ignore them because sims 4 now got updated, and now there are scenarios that makes the game non-repeative as well as the bugs got fixed !!",Recommended

19,Seasons 리뷰,ever since i purchased and downloaded this add on my game has taken up to 30 minutes to load the start screen after choosing the season still hasnt loaded and nothing changes no matter how many times i restart the game i'm about to uninstall sims all together,Not Recommended
20,Seasons 리뷰,"I just bought Seasons, on sale, and I read the reviews on it first. I saw a lot of complains regarding people feeling as though they think it should be base game. I thought the same thing too BEFORE I bought it.

I absolutely love Seasons! It's so much fun, making snowmen and snow angels, you get a bunch a holidays and one there's an option to create your own! Completing the traditions is also very fun. Holidays aren't like events so you can leave you lot and the holiday simply follows you. Since I'm a seasoned player now, it's very easy for me to navigate through such a huge change. But new players would struggle. Coming into Sims having never played before, you're still figuring how to play, when the Seasons and weather change outside your Sim has to dress accordingly, with the base game you can decide what you want them to wear and there's no consequences. Not quite the same in Seasons. Also, a new player would have to know to periodically save on the off chance your Sim does somehow die and they wouldn't know that, I didn't.

Also, a HUGE amount of flowers, plants, veggies, and fruits are seasonal. Meaning you can't grow them or tend to them if you already have them, when they're out of season. So using that little hack of raising a lot of money fast when you come into Sims would be out of the question.

Seasons is sooo much fun if you're a seasoned player, but it's quire restricting if you were new. Anyways, I'd recommend this pack, especially to spice up your game play, but I would get it on sale. I would not pay $40 for this addition.

P.S. It comes with a LOT of CAS options, for almost all sections of clothes/design, as well as for every age group and that usually doesn't happen with packs.",Recommended
21,Seasons 리뷰,"10/10 definitely recommend! The seasons pack brings so much more to gameplay. It would actually be boring without the seasons changing, also allowing you to do different things for each season such as in Winter, you can play in the snow, etc. My favorite is getting to decorate for Christmas. :))",Recommended

35,Seasons 리뷰,"Honestly not a bad pack, in my opinion its one of the best expansion packs. Or, at least my favorite. So cool on how it adds weather and events we celebrate in real life. Just wish this was base game, doesn't seem necessary to place it as a bought pack.",Recommended
36,Seasons 리뷰,just bought this but when i load the game up its says unowned,Recommended
37,Seasons 리뷰,"There's a lot of complaining that the contents of this pack should be included in the base game, but I don't agree with that.

In the main, this pack only adds an element of unpredictability by ruining your teenagers' outdoor party plans with thunderstorms that they're all scared of. You don't need that in the base game, because that kind of entertainment is enjoyed best with more experience. You miss the nuanced interactions when you first start playing, because you're too focused on getting that toddler in the high chair. You also don't need seasonal produce in the base game, because it's much easier to get to grips with the basics when the basics are always in season. That goes for gardening, fishing, and any other outdoor activity you've added to game.

The Seasons pack adds a little more depth and richness to the base game, and that's probably why it's deemed an important DLC. Along with weather and seasonality you also get the addition of holidays, which come with various tasks for your sims to check off. These could be simply choosing certain social interactions, decorating in a seasonal theme, or challenging Akira Kibo to a scrap. You can delete them, though, if they become irritating. Or you can add more holidays in which you get to deck the Kibo. You can also throw snowballs and water balloons at him, and nail him right in his angry little face. You need the City pack to meet Akira Kibo, but you can substitute your own favourite angry sim instead (but it won't be as much fun).

Like everything in the SIms 4, the animations and attention to detail are charming, like a sim taking a moment to appreciate the first flakes of snow falling that year. Decor items are mostly mid-century modern inspired, with some truly ugly holiday decor pieces to appreciate. Bees are also fun, partly for the honey but also because I enjoy watching a certain angry sim run away from them, howling.

In terms of gameplay this pack doesn't add as much activity content as say, City Living or the Snowy Escape Weeaboo packs, but it adds a richness and diversity to whatever gameplay you're currently enjoying, so it's worth a sale purchase for that.",Recommended

42,Seasons 리뷰,"I haven't tried this yet, but the video for it looks great! I mean for real, this pack has all 4 seasons, winter,summer,fall and of course spring! But my favorite about it is that it can snow and the kids can play in the snow! And when they go outside they can play on the swing set! When I was little I would swing on the swing set in the backyard and slide down the slide. One time when I went outside, now this is funny but I don't think it was to my dog! I put him on the slide and he yelped a little while sliding down! No, I don't think torture is funny! It was when I was 5 or 6 I honestly can't remember!",Recommended

53,Seasons 리뷰,"It’s all right but a little bit overrated. Contrary to popular belief I don’t think this pack is necessary to enjoy or even get the full experience of the game, and sometimes I feel the game would be easier without it, between all the random holidays I don’t care about and blizzards non-stop all winter (ugh blizzards). It’s not a bad pack and I don’t regret buying on sale and in a bundle, but anyone who says it’s the “pack to get if you’re only gonna buy one” or “the new base game after TS4 went free to play” I personally don’t agree with. If you are going to buy just one pack for this game I’d suggest Growing Together, Get To Work, City Living or maybe even Parenthood before Seasons.",Recommended

Prank Day? You want my sim to make everyone angry at them for the sake of a holiday or else they will pout? Cool.

ALL other games would make this a free update that you didn't need to pay for but ea wants all of your money so this feature which should have been in the base game because idk ITS THE SEASONS AND HOLIDAYS but no you have to pay 40 bucks for it. It adds so little it is staggering but that's how every paid update is it adds so little you wonder if anyone pays for this crap and if anyone will burn down ea for this but no they keep making you pay for updates THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN FREE.,Not Recommended
63,Seasons 리뷰,Makes gardening really annoying and my plants look nasty all the time now : /,Not Recommended
64,Seasons 리뷰,"Get it on sale. Wonderful slice-of-life addition to the base game.

Seasons doesn't bring anything particularly special to the game, other than literally seasons and weather - there's no skills or new gameplay that really stands out to me, it's just a good solid addition that makes the game feel so much more immersive. (Details about calendar and holidays at the end of this review.)

I find myself doing little things far more now that I have seasons, eg having my sims drink coffee and read books by the fire while there's snow falling outside. Or eating more fruit salads in summer, etc.

This DLC really brings the game to life in my opinion, but I always rush to get the aspiration points which allow your sims to ignore the cold/heat, because it is WAY too easy to die from freezing or overheating.

* There is a calendar now, and holidays. There are pre-set holidays which you can alter or completely delete, and you can make your own holidays. Your holidays can have any name and theme you want, you can set them any day you want, and you can choose activities/traditions. You can even set a holiday to be a day off of work/school, so your sims get a free day. It's really cute to add a ""snow day"" midweek in winter and have your family stay home and just build snowmen together.

Additionally, a sim's traits will have an effect on holiday traditions - eg a flirty sim will really love ""Love Day"", and will easily have a great day. While an unflirty sim will ignore ""Love Day"", which means the traditions they don't like will be greyed out and they won't want to do any of the activities.

Although these are great features, I don't find myself using them as much as I thought I would. I find it particularly frustrating that you can't see every holiday on the calendar - only the ones within a few weeks from your current date. And you can't delete a holiday that's already started. Which means every year I'm surprised by one particular holiday that I find annoying, because I never remember about it in time to delete it completely.

*Also; Patchy the scarecrow is awesome and I can't believe it took me so long to realise that the scarecrow is actually interesting and not just a big (kinda ugly) decoration.",Recommended

66,Seasons 리뷰,i love this game,Recommended
67,Seasons 리뷰,"EA has turned The Sims into a giant paradox. I dig playing the content even though it's buggy and completely soulless from earlier iterations of the franchise. Absolutely none of the content is worth it's full price and the penchant to release paid DLC that doesn't even bring the Sims 4 up nearly to par with where it's predecessor left off is enough to make me look forward with great anticipation to titles like Paralives.
You can dive into this game, but you'll find yourself needing more DLC than seems necessary to flesh out the game. Given that Sims 5 will most likely be online multiplayer with in-game purchases, though, it's probably the last Sims game that will bear any resemblance to anything but the ""metaverse"".",Recommended
68,Seasons 리뷰,This should've been in base game but whatever,Recommended
69,Seasons 리뷰,"I will say this is probably the best DLC to get if you're thinking of buying one for the Sims 4. I like how it changes the look of every world and adds holiday items and events, as well as the pack-exclusive furniture. However, I think it is completely overpriced for what it is and should only cost around $20.",Recommended
70,Seasons 리뷰,"Personally, I think the seasons adds a lot of gameplay. Pros of the pack, are flowers, trees and the ground is effected by the weather, You get snow and leaf piles, adds a lot of new interactions. Also, You get a ton of different weather during the duration. The only con I think there is, I kinda wish you could make the seasons last longer. Max is 28 days.",Recommended
71,Seasons 리뷰,This DLC is the best for the game but 40$ for something that is essential for a life sim? It made sense for like the Sims 2 becuase it was a complex thing to add back then but c'mon now a days I can add the weather to any game,Recommended
72,Seasons 리뷰,"This is a good pack. The seasons are pretty, and I like how they integrated them into every world. Another thing that I like is how different worlds have different weather patterns and climates in Seasons (Like Oasis Springs being rainy during fall and winter, as well as Sulanii). Before the Sims became free, I also thought that it was ridiculous for seasons to be a pack, let alone one that was 40 dollars! Now that the Sims 4 is free, I think it's fine that seasons aren't base game, because the Sims 4 is now there for people to dip their toes in without having to pay 20 dollars to do so. The Sims 4 Seasons is an actual Expansion of the game, so I see why it's not a Game pack. However, I think that it is over priced. I think that Expansion packs in general are all over priced, but that's EA for you...

A lot of people say this pack should be a game pack. I disagree, because although it doesn't come with a world, it comes with so many aspects that effect the pre-existing worlds and game play. I now play The Sims 4 on my new PC instead of my Xbox; DLCs bought for this game on the Xbox aren't transferable, so I have had to play TS4 basegame-only for a while now. The absence that I've felt the most of was Seasons. It was weird always being in spring and not having weather.
Because of how used you get to this pack, I feel it appears much smaller than it actually is to most players that have had it for a long time.

The events are cute, and I like how they give you the option to delete and edit preexisting ones, as well as the option to make your own Holidays entirely. There are Build and Buy items that pose as decorations. These items, though kinda few, have many swatches to match with specific Holidays, as well as some obscure swatches that you could use for custom holidays.

The NPCs that come with this pack are ok. My favorite one is Father Winter because I always made my sims marry him for his wealth. Cheats were (and still are) a pain on the console editions, so Father Winter was an alternative way for easy money. (PS, he has 500,000 Simolions.) His children always came out looking a bit weird, but you get used to it. One of the NPCs is the spring bunny. Some people aren't aware of this NPC because TS4's version of Easter isn't in the game by default. You would need to add him manually to an event for him to appear.

Back when this was first released, TS4's basegame was like a shriveled up worm on the side walk that you paid for, and the packs were the moisture you needed to plump it up again that you also had to pay for. Now, TS4's base game has some moisture of it's own, so packs aren't TS4's only life force anymore. That combined with the fact that it's free now makes it completely possible to enjoy the game (somewhat) without any packs. Before the game itself was free, you would've definitely needed this pack to pad it out. It still helps a lot to pad out today's basegame, but its not necessary anymore.
I recommend buying this when it's on sale or begging your rich friend or family member to buy it for you.",Recommended
73,Seasons 리뷰,"This is an expansion pack that everyone should really buy if they will only buy one pack or want lots of new gameplay. Pretty sure this could be in the base game but we all know it's ea but yeah, I'm only recommending it base on how good is the pack. Since this pack will affect every single world in the game, it's sad that there's no new world with this pack. Custom holidays are also fun to have if you like to play with celebration. This pack will affect a lot to the gameplay, such as temperature and climate, so it's fun to have different challenges and gameplay since you can't do certain things at certain climate or seasons. But again, only buy it when on sale.",Recommended

82,Seasons 리뷰,"I REALLY recommend buying this DLC as it has great replayability and adds to the existing gameplay without having you go out of your way to play with it. It adds a lot to the gameplay by adding 2 new outfit categories; cold weather and hot weather. It also adds many more ""create a sim"" (CAS) items such as swimwear and jackets for male, female and unisex, which appeals to players who perfect their sims in CAS. This is a very big positive for the seasons extension pack though it is quite annoying that after its release the main game got a hot weather and cold weather outfit category update which is annoying as people spent money to buy this extension and then a part of the extension is being added to the main game for free. Regarding gameplay, this extension can be played without forcing you to go out of your way to play with it. This is because the seasons will change automatically as well as add weather like lightning affects the gameplay since you can get struck and die this makes the Sims 4 more interesting as well as make it more relatable as we all experience rain and makes the player want to reenact things that you can only do in certain weather. This brings us to holidays which have been added to intertwine with the seasons for example father Christmas has been added to the game as well as Christmas during the winter season. A step froward would be if the different worlds would have different seasons at the same time as if they are on a different side of the world. Something like this is in place where oasis Springs gets much hotter during summer and not has cold during winter which i really like. Next is build buy (BB) items like the thermostat and Hanukkah candelabra is added to intertwine with the fact that now sims can overheat and freeze as well as adding items which relate to the holidays. I really like the fact that other holidays are added apart from Christmas as that is reality and makes it feel more real and relatable. As well as the fact that if you don't get a thermostat it can really change the gameplay (can make sims uncomfortable from the heat). In BB there is also a lot of new furniture with swatches which match different seasons even though there are many warm coloured swatches there are also a few cool coloured swatches which is kinda a con. There are many more things to talk about the seasons expansion pack though this are the most eye catching parts, all together i really recommend getting this pack and you will not regret it.

For example you cant really go jogging in a heatwave or you might die ahshjdas, or swim in winter bc you may freeze to death if you stay in the water for to long. Also the holidays are something I use without thinking about it and I really couldnt imagine how boring the game would be without this pack.

95,Seasons 리뷰,"If you've ever heard someone say, ""You can't really play the sims without seasons."" , they aren't exaggerating one bit.
Okay, maybe a little.
This game pack is pretty much essential to have the full experience of base game as it involves, you guessed it, seasons, holidays, festivities, and others. If you were ever just playing in base game and wondering, ""where does the hot and cold outfits in CAS come to play?"", just know that they are essentially useless UNTIL you get seasons. Because I am a new player in the community, (joined about a year ago) I have no idea if the hot and cold outfits in CAS existed before seasons or if they added the categories to base game after seasons released. I'll get into the PROS and CONS section before you get bored.

PROS:
- Hot+Cold temperature outfit categories in CAS are finally usable
- Cute CAS items in general
- GOOD SWIMSUITS AFTER SOO LONG
- Snow+fall leaves
- Holidays (Christmas, Fall's bounty, Valentines day, New years, ect.)
- More outdoor build items (kiddie pool, swings)
-Cute build items in general
- Literally the cutest and most versatile short hair in CAS
- Thermostat in build
-New gameplay

CONS
- Should be free/come with base game because of how much you can miss out on
- Doesn't come with new world (seriously, it should just be with base game}
- Father Winter (Santa Clause) is really annoying if you have a vacant Christmas house
- Some events can also be really annoying and if you end them early without thought, your sim says the day was horrible

For the most part, I really do recommend because we know EA will never make this free in the future and this likewise won't come with base game. I and a few reviewers all recommend you buy Seasons at half price, or full price if you really are desperate.",Recommended
96,Seasons 리뷰,"It can ad fun to the game when you can have different seasons, look forward to different events, and it also tells you on the calendar when stuff will happen like Halloween, Christmas, and Punching day (I forget what it's actually called) as you see in the video the DLC ads all of the IRL seasons.

104,Seasons 리뷰,Although The Sims is a life simulation game I find it quite unfair that you have to buy seasons as it is a realistic aspect of life and the least they could have done was added a world along with it if we have to buy it.

107,Seasons 리뷰,"It's bizarre to me how many reviews for Sims packs and expansions are negative because of the price. Yeah, EA is greedy, we know this. Buy it on sale, like everyone does.

Pretty obvious what this expansion does, and it does it well, which is all there is to say about the actual seasons. Weather is varied and affects moodlets, the type of weather you get is dependent on what neighborhood you choose, and you get all the expected seasonal activities (snow ball fights and building snowmen, water balloon fights, etc).

Similar to The Sims 3 Seasons, this adds holidays. What's new is that this has mechanics similar to parties or dates, where you're given a number of objectives to complete in order for the Sim's holiday to be successful or not, (positive moodlet or negative moodlet afterwards). The objectives also vary depending on a Sim's personality. Evil Sims won't be ""sharing thankful spirit"" on Harvestfest, etc.

The holidays are also customizable, so you can swap out or turn off ones you don't want to bother with (eg, getting rid of ""party spirit"" for New Years) and you can also make custom holidays, with some otherwise unused traditions giving you the option to make the sims equivalents of easter or Halloween.

All in all, the expansion adds a lot, and makes for more interesting gameplay. Definitely one of the few ""must have"" expansion packs.",Recommended

Seasons is a great DLC. CAS and BB items are all good, but that's not the real focus here. The, well, seasons of this pack are great. They're such background elements to the game but in the best way - just more life in the background. And they add perks too when weather events happen, you can shower in the rain/play in the snow ect. And the holidays are all good, and the fact you can make your own is even better. And the random ones that pop up are nice as well, and add more randomness the Sims desperately wants and needs. It's also fun when paired with Vampires, since it allows them to be outside not just at night. I would still buy it on sale, of course, it's EA but it is one of the packs you should buy if you want Sims 4 DLC.",Recommended
152,Seasons 리뷰,I highly recommend this DLC... however not for $40. I bought this DLC for $17 and that seems like the right amount (possibly up to $20) As you would expect this DLC brings seasons into the game (at least I think. I bought this with the base game so I have not played without it) It lets you choose what season you want to start in. In addition to keeping your sims feed and bathed now you have to make sure they are properly clothed. This is an amazing DLC and I highly recommend. Just wait to buy it when it's on sale.,Recommended

164,Seasons 리뷰,"I’m only recommending this because it is such a game changer and I cannot imagine playing without it. However, given my love-hate relationship with this game, I will list a few pros and cons to let you decide for yourself.

Pros:
- Adds weather and seasons to your game (also makes hot/cold outfits finally useful)
- Adds gardening career as well as new CAS/Build & Buy items
- Adds a calendar to your game along with holidays that are fully customizable (so if you want to add Easter, Halloween or even Hanukkah to your game, you can!)

Cons:
- Too expensive
- Doesn’t add a new world to your game
- Should have already been in the base game (but this IS from EA after all)

In conclusion:

I understand why there are so many negative reviews, as Seasons has been an add on at least since The Sims 2. At some point you would think EA would just include some of this stuff in the base game, but if you don't like it, don't buy it. Or you can pay the full price and then go around complaining about it, as if you didn't have a choice. Absurd.

Anyways. Seasons is exactly what you expect--it adds the four seasons to the game, along with holidays, seasonal activities, and the gardener career. Content-wise, I'd say it still pales in comparison to the incanration of this DLC from The Sims 3, which added festivals and a plethora of small details (snow days, igloos you can sleep in, pumpkin carving, snowboarding, ocean swimming, diving, etc.). Now if you want all of those features you have to buy this DLC, Island Living, Spooky Stuff, Cottage Living, etc. However, it does include a myriad of styles, CAS items, build and buy items, interactions, traits, and changes up the game in many new ways that, frankly, TS4 needed badly.

PROS:

- Each season has its own unique effects on the world and the sims in it

- Season length can be slightly customized

- Holidays are plentiful and customizeable, allowing you to completely erase holidays you don't like or edit them into being more fun, and even make completely new holidays

- Expanded gardening, which I think ties in well with an DLC like Cottage Living

- New actions and interactions like showering in the rain, grand meals, declaring weather preference, etc.

- WooHoo in leaf pile

- Gift giving

- New traits and rewards for sims to better acclimate to weather conditions

- New deaths (overheating, freezing, struck by lightning)

- New outfits for hot and cold weather


CONS:

- Many interactions (such as declaring weather preference) have little to no effect on gameplay that I have seen

- Holidays can sometimes be annoying and can have obnoxious requirements, and it is not openly communicated to the player that they can edit holidays

- Every sims is terrified of storms regardless of age, unless they buy a specific trait

- Dying of heat is extremely punishing and happens way too quickly. Summertime=stay inside or you'll burst into flames


Despite its abundant flaws, I highly recommend Seasons. As usual, however, buy on sale.",Recommended

195,Seasons 리뷰,"Finally, a reason for all those different outfits. I feel this should have been part of the base game. But since it isn't, it's a must have for Sims 4.",Recommended
196,Seasons 리뷰,"Most of the DLCS in this game you actively have to try to use on purpose. For example, in order to play as a vampire you have to make your sim one when first building them or pursue getting turned into one during the game play.

Seasons is the only one that affects you whether you like it or not, 10/10 would recommend.",Recommended
197,Seasons 리뷰,"Seasons makes the world of The Sims 4 feel more real and I can't imagine playing without seasons and holidays anymore! It’s exciting playing through each season, watching the leaves change from greens to reds, falling off and then budding anew. There are tons of new items, but what sets it apart are the ways it changes the game. It adds so many new activities and things to do and wonderful holidays, it honestly made me feel like this is the first must have expansion for The Sims 4!!! :)",Recommended
198,Seasons 리뷰,"Yup, This is actually a good one it adds a ton more than just weather and seasons. All kinds of outfits to play with, tons of decorations for the seasons and added holidays which you can also make your own days to celebrate, The Holidays have goals to accomplish and you can play in the rain and have water balloon fights! I would say most people will enjoy Seasons.",Recommended

200,Seasons 리뷰,"I would say that this DLC is essential, it adds so many elements to the already existing game to the point that it would feel weird to not have this DLC anymore. Having the seasons change is a super welcome addition, and in conjunction with the holidays it makes the sims world feel, well more like IRL.

Is it worth $40 though? No, no it's not considering that $40 is pretty much more than the price of the game itself at this point (Sims 4 is always going on sales, for very cheap too). If you can find this DLC on sale for 50% or more, and you enjoy the Sims 4 and want a content pack that gives you the ""most to do"", I would say it is worth it.",Recommended

203,Seasons 리뷰,Literally game changing. Don't know why we need to pay a premium for weather in a life simulator...but oh well. You can't really live without the weather and EA knows that! CAS options are a little meh. The Build/Buy is great. The Holidays/Seasons are great. Calendar is a nice touch.

219,Seasons 리뷰,I really like this pack. The different holidays can get a bit weird and annoying but overall its super fun I really like the flower addition and gardening career. The bees are a bit chaotic not sure why they are so difficult to care for ? The different seasons are a lot of fun though but a part of me feels like this should already just be in the game and not a dlc.,Recommended
220,Seasons 리뷰,"Having different seasons and holidays was always a big favorite in prior Sims versions, and I'm glad to see that expanded upon in Sims 4 with the ability to customize new holidays to my households' unique gameplay.",Recommended
221,Seasons 리뷰,"Man I totally regret not getting this pack sooner. Its absolutely my favourite. If I had to recommend an order so far (from the packs I have at least), this would be number one. However, only by a hair against cats and dogs. *side note* the dlc for the dlc of cats n dogs is really stupid. don't waste your money on it unless its already in an amazing bundle of something youre dying to buy. The stuff in that pack is just... its essentially unusable.

anyways, I never thought I would be so damn stoked for rain haha. The storms and everything add such amazing depth especially when combined with a lot of my other packs (ie. paranormal themes). and the fall/outfit combos, and the snow! the game play content is just so huge.

If you play the base game. Just get it. Dont forget to look and purchase it in the bundle though to save you some simoleans.",Recommended

223,Seasons 리뷰,"Despite this being by far the most justifiable ts4 dlc to buy, the price and it being dlc at all is not. This adds a lot of fundamental content to the game, which is actually very bad considering you have to buy 40 dollar dlc for your sims to be able to experience a year with weather. Think about how abysmal that sounds. I genuinely had a good time with this, but due to the greed present in the way this dlc is distributed and my own basic morals I can't recommend this in a good conscience.

My advice? Support fan mods and custom content instead. Giving like 10 dollars to support quality content going towards a regular person trying to make a living instead of the most notoriously greedy company known to gaming is obviously preferable. Or buy this when it's on like 70% sale, that works too.",Not Recommended
224,Seasons 리뷰,Just because of the audacity of selling this separately.,Not Recommended
225,Seasons 리뷰,This pack is a must-have! Very customisation and adds so much realism to the game. The holiday feature is great and brings sims closer together.,Recommended
226,Seasons 리뷰,It's pretty good. Although I shouldn't have to pay $40 for it to be a bit cloudy but I like the pack. it really does improve gameplay and I am glad I got it. screw EA though.,Recommended
227,Seasons 리뷰,"I know people ♥♥♥♥♥ about how there's too much dlc and you feel like you're being gouged and I agree. This ""Seasons"" absolutely should be part of the base game. It adds the passage of time to the base game which makes everything feel more engaging. If you can afford it, I'd say this is one of the few must have expansion packs. Or wait and grab it on sale. But, seriously, EA, this should be free or part of the base game.",Recommended

There is no new world, but the seasons and holidays alone are worth it.

Buy it during a sale. And yes, there's a new way to Woohoo...in the pile of leaves during fall season.",Recommended
235,Seasons 리뷰,"Possibly the best DLC for SIMS 4 without adding another world. If you have the other Expansion Packs, this Pack itself works well with them. To me, this pack adds more realism to the game as well as some traits you will need to overcome. The base was a bit mono-tone when it comes to outdoor activities. The holidays are enjoyable especially during Fall and Winter. Thanksgiving and Christmas were my favorite. When it comes to Spring, the Gardening skill comes super handy as well being a Gardener in Career. The daily activities are fun too. Again those activities work well with other Expansion Packs. Talking like a Pirate in the Island Pack is hilarious. Make sure you add a Thermostat in your homes and businesses.",Recommended

244,Seasons 리뷰,"It's very safe to say that I've loved this DLC since the moment I started playing it, zero regrets on buying it. While I did enjoy the base game already, it felt a bit off with every day being sunny and bright outside - it's nice to have some variety finally! I went ahead and listed some of the pros and cons I've run into since using this pack.


Pros:
- Adds different seasons (obviously) and weather (I actually get a chance to use the hot/cold weather outfits I gave my sims before I got this :D).
- A calendar to keep track of birthdays, upcoming holidays, work days, etc. You can create your own holidays/modify existing ones as well (the calendar has been added to the base game, but it's still different from the one that comes in this pack)
- During holidays, you have to help your sims complete tasks throughout the day to celebrate - some sims won't care for certain parts of holidays based on their personalities, and some others will absolutely LOVE them.
- Lots of holiday decorations! You can decorate both inside and out for any holiday.
- Flower arrangement table (also comes with a career based on it!) that you can use to create bouquets; you can either sell your bouquets or use them to decorate your home.
- Scouting activity for your children.
- Patchy the Scarecrow, who can give your sims seeds to plant and tips on gardening. When he comes to life, he can help out with your garden and you can interact with him.



Cons (a few small things, they're still worth mentioning though):
- Gnomes can be annoying with leaving seed packets lying around (I removed the gnome addition to Harvest Fest since I didn't really want to deal with it).
- Patchy sometimes starts new plants where I don't want him to. It's not a big deal since you can remove what he plants, it's just a little tedious sometimes.
- When sims rake leaves or make snowpeople, sometimes they get put in areas they shouldn't. I had a sim go out to rake leaves, and for some reason she decided to put the pile in the kitchen. Another sim went out to make a snowman and placed it right in front of the main door. However, they can be removed/moved in build mode.
- Sims might start mopping outside in the rain. I had a sim assume that all puddles on the property must be cleaned during a rainstorm and I couldn't get her to come back inside for a while despite repeatedly cancelling her actions.
- Some holidays feel repetitive or boring, but you can always delete them and create your own.
- I initially put the weather machine in my pros, but upon playing more often I found that I never really used it. It feels very underwhelming.


Despite the cons, which really are pretty miniscule, I still recommend it!",Recommended
245,Seasons 리뷰,"This is huge - it completely changes the gameplay and makes it feel so well rounded. You can check off anything that you don't really want to participate in, but honestly I don't think you'd want to. There's also a lot more ways to kill a sim...",Recommended
246,Seasons 리뷰,"Too expensive. Why I need to pay HK$319 to season and weather?
I recommend this DLC. However, I don't want to give a positive comment",Not Recommended
247,Seasons 리뷰,"This is, in my opinion, one of the strongest packs for Sims 4 and should be one of the first packs that you buy with Sims 4. I consider it to be tied for #1 pack with the Cats & Dogs expansion. Most of the features (seasons, weather, holidays) of this pack are fundamental to making the Sims a robust life simulation experience, and the game would feel very strange without it. Other expansions/packs do build on Seasons features, making this one of the farthest reaching expansions.",Recommended
248,Seasons 리뷰,honestly i cant think of any reason not to get this pack. Its useful for challenges as well as everyday game play. The cas is super cute and the build mode style is usable almost anywhere. I totally recommend this pack.,Recommended
249,Seasons 리뷰,"I like how they put in the setting and give me option to make the season short or longer, because i prefer it to be longer so that i can plant seasonal plants and take my time to harvest them.",Recommended
250,Seasons 리뷰,"Thanks to some m0r0n who built a snowman in front of the door of the building where I live, I was locked up in the house without having the chance to get out.

What happened? My best friend died frozen because he could not go into the house, I found a family of guests inside my house, where they broke me: 3 stereos, a shower, a sink, a bathtub, a television and an oven microwave.
I couldn't chase them, as they couldn't get out the front door for the 7uck1ng snowman.
The child of this family kept pissing on the floor. They ate and left the dishes on the floor until they passed out on ground. In short, my small house had literally turned into a toilet, as even the maid could not go up to clean the house and I was too busy with jobs and developing skills, with people complaining and at best whipping their anger against me.

Oh yes, I forgot: the ghost of my best friend haunted my house as his grave was downstairs, and I could not free the spirit because ... THE 7UCK1NG SNOWMAN WON'T LET ME OUT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE!

Thanks EA.",Not Recommended
251,Seasons 리뷰,"I wasn't sure about whether I should get this pack or not. I'm honestly glad I did! Rather than adding a new area to live, it adds a bunch of awesome new mechanics, items, clothes, and events to the game. Your sim can celebrate holidays, enjoy the weather, plant a seasonal garden, go skating, invite friends over for holiday dinners. Missing a holiday will give sims a negative moodlet, which is possibly my biggest complaint about this pack. Your sim can also be afraid of thunderstorms and get a tense moodlet for the day. On the sims Thanksgiving, gnomes will appear in your house and leave tons of seed packets, worth 100 simoleans a piece. You can sell them and make a killing, and I'm talking thousands just from appeasing the gnomes. The game was still good without the changing seasons, but it feels like a different experience altogether. I recommend it.",Recommended
252,Seasons 리뷰,This is the most important expansion to have for this game. Its features go beyond this expansion and change parts of other expansions as well.,Recommended
253,Seasons 리뷰,"This is basically a must have expansion pack.
Even though there's no new world and life-state, it compensates the balance by giving your gameplay a more realistic feeling. The weather and holidays tasks will affect directly your sims' emotions. So, things like decorating your home for christmas for example isn't something supeficial anymore like previous games. By the way, we got a Santa now, and you're able to fight the sh*t out him for presents.",Recommended
254,Seasons 리뷰,"This is the ESSENTIAL pack of Sims 4. Without this one, the game feels very strange and lacking.

The pack obviously introduces Seasons and with that it brings Holidays to the game, where your Sims can celebrate a certain day.

Pros:
- Adds Seasons with different Weather (Simulation game without Seasons?)
- Introduces the calendar with different Holidays (bringing new gameplay posibilities)
- Lots of Build Mode stuff
- Outdoor Activities!!!

Cons:
- CAS stuff, not very interesting
- Not a whole lot of new things to Gameplay were added.",Recommended
255,Seasons 리뷰,"Don't kick the gnomes in the face

TL;DR it adds seasons lol

This is a good DLC, something which should be part of the core game. But hey it's EA and the game has no competition so what you're gonna do?

It adds all four seasons and changes the game drastically. You get to celebrate the holidays. Like Christmas, Valentines day and many others. You get challenges/tasks to celebrate the day. Like decorating your house, having a romantic time with your lover, beat someone up when the brawl day comes up, rebate day when you get money back from buying items, free food day or new year when you shout at the TV when the clock hit 00:00 and celebrate with toasts. You also need to interact with your friends or some items to make your holiday successful. These are really fun and adds a lot to the game.

There's a calendar with all the events and if you want you can create a new event like your birthday and celebrate it with your friends and family.
You also get some garden items. You can plant vegetable for example and take of them in your garden which is another yay if you love this stuff.

On top of that there's constantly changing weather which enriches the game a lot. Sure it's not much from the first look but it makes a huge difference. You can build a snowpal when there's snow or throw snowballs at each other. In fall you can woohoo in the stinking pile of leaves, how fun is that? Yay lol In spring it's time to take care of your plants in the garden. In summer? Hmm i don't think there's much going on in summer.
You get a thermostat and need to adjust it to the weather like hotter/colder depending on the season.
Besides all the major stuff you get new career - gardener, a bunch of new clothing items to make your sim prettier (or uglier), skills, traits and other items related to flora.

This is a really good DLC, just not for the full price. It adds a lot and changes the whole game. I just wish there would be more bundles when it comes to Sims 4 DLC. Would make more people to buy it.",Recommended
256,Seasons 리뷰,"Seasons is indispensable to a good Sims4 Experience, and should be way more impactful than it already is.

Seasons adds four seasons to the game, a calendar that provides for holidays and planning, various bits of weather and related content, and more. When I think of which of the packs I already own that i find myself using most and wondering why there isn't more? It's Seasons.

Of the items that Seasons adds, it's surprising that there's not more than one thermostat, or one of other functional furniture items. Of the Aspirations and traits added, it also surprises me how sparingly they tend to add such things across all products.

For sure, Seasons is one of many of the existing products that should be free. Future games should package the functionality of this pack as part of the base game. Nevertheless, I recommend this DLC because it's just so fundamentally important to a game like this.",Recommended

It adds special kind of features that cannot be download as mods, so I would say it's worth it (the 20 bucks, I mean). Living in a place where there are all the four seasons in real life, I really wanted that in the game as well, and so far haven't been disappointed. Works better than in Sims 3, since there are different weather sets and the transition from season to season is more natural. Not like Sims 3 where one morning there suddenly was snow on the ground. Now it gets cold first and then the leaves start to fall and the winter creeps up on you. It's a neat xpack.",Recommended

This is a great pack for fans of build/buy, it gives you a lot of places to play in thanks to apartments and presents fun creative challenges by forcing you to work with the pre-determined building perimeters. Unfortunate that you can't design your own apartment but there's an expansion for that too. This is an older pack so my biggest issue is the colour swatches on some items are no longer in trend.",Recommended
276,City_Living 리뷰,"Maybe an unpopular opinion but this is my favorite sims pack! As someone who likes to decorate but doesn't like to build and likes the challenge of smaller spaces, apartments are perfect for me. Festivals are also great get-togethers with other sims or places to meet new ones. I also love the singing skill, new careers, and different city quarters.

282,City_Living 리뷰,"I want to give this a 'meh' rating because there are equal parts good and bad to it, though I have to lean more toward negative.

The big appeal to City Living is obviously the more urban setting as opposed to the traditional suburban setting for Sims. This is accomplished by creating a semi-open world where multiple lots connect to a single hub 'neighborhood'. This is not the open world that Sims 3 had as there are still loading screens when moving from lot to lot, but you can leave your apartment and head out into the bustling community without having to go through a loading screen. This makes it easier to access the community events that happen so often.

Unfortunately apartment living suffers from a major drawback: noisy neighbors. At first you'll think ""oh, just like real apartment living!"" - and yeah, noisy neighbors is an unfortunate reality of apartment living. But the way it's implemented in the game is incredibly random, tedious, and annoying to deal with. Neighbors will be noisy for no apparent reason, with no apparent conditions, at completely inconsistent times. There may not even be any Sims in the apartment at the time. Confronting neighbors does nothing but stop the noise at that moment in time. No matter how you approach them, or how they respond, they will be noisy at a later date. There's no reason why the neighbors are noisy - they just are. As long as you have neighbors they will always be noisy at some point.

This of course makes it difficult for your Sims to concentrate on anything, and literally prevents them from being able to sleep. Noise from neighbors will always reach everyone in the apartment - no matter how far they are from the source - and wake up everyone who is sleeping, preventing them from going to bed. Worse still sometimes *you* are the noisy neighbor without it being clear why, and of course your neighbors will confront you about it. But there's literally nothing to tell you what it is that's causing noise.

Apartments are also weird in that they may bug your visitors, preventing them from doing anything - including leaving. Had a guest stuck in a ""leaving"" state while literally sleeping in a bed. Had to physically move the bed in build mode to reset her so she could leave. One of the neighbors' apartments - for some strange reason - kept attracting Sims who would just stand inside it and do nothing, never leaving, until they finally died due to their needs being neglected. This happened until the Sim who rented the apartment finally died.

One of the lots you can visit was also bugged so that when your Sims left it you would be stuck at the lot and could not switch to your Sims or their lot without saving and then reloading the game. Another time I had move apartments because a neighbor was being noisy, but even though the noise had stopped and the moodlets had vanished the game was still acting like there was noise so my Sims couldn't go to sleep.

Altogether, City Living hasn't been that great of an experience. Performance tends to drop during community events, the 'noisy neighbors' feature is more annoying than anything, there was no way to turn off the special lot conditions, and there were more than a few bugs impeding gameplay. IMHO this DLC doesn't live up to it's potential.",Not Recommended

284,City_Living 리뷰,I read others comments how they dislike the building system but as a person who finds building rather time consuming and want to decorate the interior...I think this DLC is perfect.

290,City_Living 리뷰,"To clear up one thing from the game trailer - you don't explore anywhere, you just visit venues via a load screen. Even if the venue is in the same district as your apartment, you'll still need to enter via a load screen, so please don't imagine you get to wander around the place holding a map. It's purely a themed collection of venues, like every other game map.

That said, the pack brought me a lot of giggles. The karaoke in particular gave me a lot of laugh out loud moments (and still does), and honestly, I'd buy the pack (on sale) for the singing skill and karaoke alone.

Other highlights include the festivals - the romance festival always brings drama, and Akira Kibo, who is just hilarious and brings even more drama. Here's this supremely confident guy who acts very cool and also scarily possessive and continually griping about his insecurities. Well, Akira, you had the girl and you lost the girl and now she's married to a gorgeous hottie and they've had three gorgeous kids. She's not coming back to you, so give it up. That's just what happens if you leave your favourite toy unattended to spend all your time playing video games, someone will nick it. No, I'm not projecting. I don't know anyone like that.

The city is the perfect place to start playing with a new generation of sims, since it's easier for them to meet, greet and socialise without a lot of effort from the player. It's a worthy addition to the base game.

I know there's always a lot of chatter about the price of sims 4 dlc, but there's so much work in this pack. The karaoke music is fantastic and must have taken a lot of time, effort, and money. The animations are precious. There's so much attention to detail. But am I saying, ""go ahead and buy it full price""? No, of course not. Wait for the sale. But it's not hard to see why the RRP is as high as it is when you consider all the work that's gone into it.

It's a tad glitchy - sometimes festivals don't load if your sim happens to be in the same district already. Sometimes vendors randomly wander into your apartment, even if the door is locked. For me they're minor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and this remains one of my favourite packs. I'd recommend it as the first addition to base game.",Recommended

296,City_Living 리뷰,"When I first started playing in San Myshuno I was a bit disappointed because I found the city quite dead, but as I continued playing I realized that the city is in fact, very lively. My simself went to the city's gym once and literally half of the Sim population was at the same gym. I do have to say that the amount of npcs is more funny than what some consider realistic, for example my simself went to the party place once to just socialize and look around. Instead I had a whole city meeting and heard 3 npcs sing karaoke in the background. There are also random protests that just start out of the ordinary. It starts with one npc, then nearly every npc that passes by joins.

Personally, I enjoy those things about this expansion pack. Oh, and, let's not forget about the festivals. The festivals are one of my favourite things about this pack. I love that there are different festivals every week, it gives so much more gameplay and realism to the pack. Another thing I really like about this pack is all the different cultures that are apparent and the variety of food from different cultures.

However, one thing that most builders may find disappointing is the fact that you can't build your own apartments. Personally, I'm an interior decorator, so I don't mind it that much, but I know that there are multiple people who do. So, if you're planning to buy a pack mostly to just build, I would say that you can pass on this one. Although, I do still think that this expansion pack is worth it, especially if it's on sale.",Recommended

For 40$ this pack doesn't add much of anything to the game, there are festivals but only like 3 and after your first time experiencing them you don't really have any motive to do them again, especially with how broken they are.

Get it on sale, or don't get it at all, you are not missing much",Not Recommended
303,City_Living 리뷰,"EDIT: If you decide to get this pack I STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you also get a mod that disables the names added by this pack, for whatever reason the name list in this pack overrides any name lists from the base game or any other pack you have installed, so basically you will have dozens of townies with the same surname and eventually tenths of NPCs with the exact same name.


I kinda liked this pack, though not as much, the new world is really nice, specially open areas in uptown are a treat to the sight, the apartments however, are difficult to like. Some CAS items are quite pretty, though build mode items are rather OK-ish. One major downside is that you can decorate as much as you want, but for most part, no building can be done, save for taking down a few walls here and there and some apartment's traits simply can't be removed.

The new NPC's and careers are rather forgettable and the new aspiration is quite useless. The festivals on the other hand are a nice addition and make for a good change in the routine, though they get old quickly. I'm specially disappointed about the Romance Festival, it is advertised as a place to find your significant other and you go only to find most, if not all the attenders, are already in a relationship, and due to the flirty mood that permeates the event, it's more like a place to go find people willing to cheat on their partners, and if you go with your SO and you don't go full toxic checking on their every move you will be cheated on for sure. Though if you are into that kink is OK I guess.

Finally there is one thing I totally despise: SINGING. Not the skill on its own, singing in the karaoke bar is fun and a nice bonding activity, but singing about holidays gets on my nerves. I'm perfectly fine with singing about winter or new year holidays, but singing about prank day, rebate day or season premiere is just plain lame. My children have been warned if I ever catch them singing about prime day or the new season of Stranger Things they will have to find a new home and they know I won't hesitate to make good on my word.

So in general I'd say recommended with reservations. If you want it just remember to follow the golden rule about anything EA-related: BUY-ON-SALE!",Recommended

I don't know why this expansion pack isn't better reviewed, as it's definitely my favorite. San Myusho is probably the best incarnation of an inner-city that The Sims has done so far. Each district feels unique, as do the variations between the apartment styles in each, and the amount of attention to the design of the setting is nuts. For the most part, most of my time playing has been in San Myusho.

Gameplay wise, the festivals and interactions with neighbors makes for some interesting Sims drama. The careers are interesting hybrids between traditional ""rabbit hole"" careers where your sim just disappear for a few hours, and the active ones where you're given the option to work from home, and are given an assignment to complete.

The only downside is probably the building options. As these are apartments, you're pretty much restricted on the outer limits of your apartment or penthouses, but you are able to change everything inside as normal. Only a few of the penthouses allow you to build additional floors as well, but that's nothing new for the apartment expansions in the franchise, and it frankly be expected as these are... apartments. Landlords usually don't like it when you knock down a wall and start building into your neighbor's kitchen.

I had just been playing heavily modded sims with about two paid worlds. (Sulani and Glimmerbrook) when I got this expansion (Along with vampires and vintage glamour, during a sale, in a combination pack.)

Let me say, this was OVERWHELMING, as the only expansions I had at the time were Island living and Seasons.
Apartments, districts, the food..the game play, all the jobs.
and combined with the Vampires pack I got I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Pros:
Apartments are awesome, best way of living and storytelling in my opinion.
The new items provided a lot of gameplay.
Multitude of new skills, a variety of ways to have fun.
The ability to give your keys to your friends, not having to individually invite them all every time.

Cons:
From what I heard, Sims 3's version of City living was open world, and this version was just a massive backdrop.
The noisy neighbors were a massive pain.
Loading screens to just visit a friend's apartment.

Korean also celebrate Christmas, why not representing Christmas by them？The post celebrates lunar new year of tiger with korean costumes and Chinese dishes, deliberately mixing two culture. This is cultural appropriation and offending Chinese players.
I love this game very much , played it almost 800+h but as a Chinese player this is unacceptable.I hope EA team could respect all the players. If you don't know how to represent other’s culture properly at least google it before posting.",Not Recommended

The downsides:
- A few of the apts come with perks you can't remove, like ""Needs TLC"" which NEVER ENDS even if you provide the TLC. It was charming for about an hour, then got so frustrating I had to move. Some players might embrace this perk for certain Sims but I could not.
- Is there a weird bug with jogging? I swear, sometimes I send my Sim to go jogging and all they do is end up downstairs and outside looking lost.

However, if you don't care for living in an apartment then this pack probably won't give you much. Except...

Lot traits are *amazing* - if you've played with the base game and/or other expansions you have probably played with some. City Living is the expansion they added them around, thus this expansion has a whole lot more of them. And the lot traits added with this are really useful.

The festivals are kind of cute, but ultimately get annoying as they pop up really often when you usually wanted to be doing something else. The Arts Center doesn't seem to have a whole lot of point, but the Karaoke bars are pretty fantastic. I personally tend to prefer the karaoke bars over the normal bars.

Compared to the other expansion packs, I would rate this as either high priority if you want apartments (though after Cats&Dogs / Seasons), or low if you don't really care about them.",Recommended
375,City_Living 리뷰,"Beautiful world brimming with lively festivals and cultural diversity

The Sims™ 4 City Living not only adds the option to live in apartments but it also adds a touch of diversity to the game. The world itself is beautiful with a lot of detail, especially if you go to the outer-sides of the lot. The little details of how you would see some of the Sims walking around in the background is quite outstanding; it definitely gives more life to the world.

The festivals is one of the loveliest feature I ever love form this pack. It brings something new rather than an event you have to plan by yourself. There are a number of festivals to choose from. There’s Geek Con, the Spice Market and the Romance Festival to name a few. Within these festivals there are a number of activities, opportunities to purchase items and eat delicious (sometimes dangerously amusing) food. It is extremely immersive and will definitely leave you dazzled after a go around.

The festival reminder is also extremely helpful and handy, especially with an option to travel straight away to where festival is held. When it first popped up saying the Flee Market would be taking place I did have a moment of panic when I realized I had no idea which neighborhood the festival was in. So the reminder was a very welcoming feature.

Not to mention, brings generous amount of additional lot traits feature. Most of the lot traits are extremely entertaining and bring unexpected surprises to your game-play experiences.

381,City_Living 리뷰,"City Living is a fundamentally important DLC.

It adds the city of San Myshuno, which adds several apartments, which are situated in 4 neighborhoods, with a park lot to the side of all them. Content-wise, this DLC also adds several other things that make living in the city exciting and eventful. For these reasons I'd recommend it, but it also comes with several bits of furniture that I find myself using a lot.

However, where the DLC falls short is in the area of pricing and quantity of cheap and ruined build items. While it seems like there's support for such things, the game doesn't take full advantage of the kind of experience that would make. For example: Why are there not town roles to be fulfilled like in Sims 3? Why can't I create new apartments in the other areas of the game by myself? Why don't your sims become figures of actual importance IN THE GAME? It seems like they could have added more if they wanted to do a good job worthy of the asking price - but that's EA/Maxis for you.

The DLC adds one new skill and a corresponding aspiration. But most importantly, it adds five new values that young sims can try to max out until they become adults. This is really good in three ways:

+ Before, teenager was just the useless life stage where you try to get the best grade in school and couldn't make babies. Now, there is an actual 'skill' that you can try to max.
+ Maxing these skills is fun. E.g. for manners, you can try to introduce yourself to everyone you run across, constantly brush your teeth or make sure the table is set up all the time.
+ Adults now get a bonus for interacting with children. Before, you were incentivised to push all teaching and parenting to neighbors instead of family members.",Recommended

397,Parenthood 리뷰,"I know, everyone says so, but I can't write a TS4 review without saying so myself: BUY ON SALE ONLY!!

Now onto the pack, after checking the description and reviews I knew I was taking a major risk with this DLC, either it would improve the gaming experience or completely ruin it, but I went for it anyway. I got to say I got lucky, it was not just an improvement but a MAJOR improvement.

It should be obvious, if you don't play families this pack is worthless, but if you do, it fills some massive voids when playing minor sims. Yeah, you got the toddler skills and children aspirations but they always felt like a chore that I always got taken care of ASAP and move my sims to teen when they are basically adults with minor or no responsibilities. What this pack adds synergies with these activities, finally making them feel natural for both parent and child.

The good:

- Things you may already do like washing dishes or helping with homework will improve the respective skill
- School projects improve your child's performance AND at the same time will provide experience for certain skills like creativity for children, handiness, programming or rocket science (among others) for teen and adults, and any other sim assisting with the project will receive the same skill gain. The kind of efficiency this game sorely lacks.
- All five values can be build from toddler to teen, but some are way easier/harder on different ages. Responsibility is very easy as teen but almost impossible as toddler, on the other hand, unless you have a very troublesome teen, conflict resolution is very hard as teen but quite easy as toddler with the ""teach to say sorry"" interaction which ALSO builds communication skill.
- At high parenting level (9 or 10, don't remember) your parent sim gets a do-it-all-at-once interaction to care for babies/infants, this I love so I can get rid of their needs in 3 seconds and proceed to ignore them for the rest of the day.
- You choose your way to deal with your children, want to hug them all day? Go ahead. Want to abuse them and turn them into little devils? Go forth fam, give'em a smack on me.
- Without this pack, except for mean/evil teens, every other teen was a well-behaved lovely creature, now they are troublesome, and in my opinion if as a teen you are not troublesome you are not doing it right.
- Finally the five traits your sim can obtain once they become young adults are VERY POWERFUL. Responsibility for example, I consider it the easiest to build and maintain, it gives the Responsible trait which takes off your sim the daily task to improve work performance, it will almost always be automatically done, freeing your sim to do whatever they want with that extra time. Also they sometimes will get special work-events that no matter what you choose, it will always have a positive impact in your work performance, and that's only one of the traits.

The bad:

- Teaching moments come in the form of calls from school or the minor sim ""asking for advice"" and it feels like the game prefers to hand them to the parent with the lower parenting skill, hence not that many options to choose from, either not impacting positively a value you want to improve or impacting negatively a value you have been working hard to improve.
- A worse situation is if you have more adults in the household than the parents because they may (too often) get these calls for advice, messing up your progress.
- I try to avoid volunteering like the plague because they get something like work-events, if succeed will improve a value, if fail will decrease it. And they tend to fail A LOT!!

The ugly:

- ""Think about a family member"" gets on my nerves, it slows down your sim while doing other activities and to me it feels like is something a creep would do.

418,Parenthood 리뷰,"First of all, I do believe this should have been part of base game, but I still recommend it (on sale, as you know to do by now hopefully.)
The negative reviews are misleading and was a huge reason I waited so long to get it. I was worried it would have a huge negative impact on the game but that is not the case, it's a great pack. I guess if you don't enjoy ""grinding"" to get your kids' skills up and maintain them (which is what makes this a video game but I digress--) then ignoring the character trait aspect is possible. How I treat the advice dialogue boxes is that I choose the dialogue that negatively impacts a skill I can easily supplement afterward. If it negatively impacts manners, you can easily choose the ""Teach to say Please and Thank you"" dialogue tree option right afterward, then praise them for learning how to say Please and Thank You which counts toward disciplining your child (part of an aspiration milestone for the ""Super Parent"" aspiration) and boosts your kid's character trait range even more. Which ties into another negative review this pack has gotten, no you do not have to make your child sim perform a bad behavior in order to discipline them. Encouraging them after they finish a school project, get a good grade, play with the doctor playset, writing in their journal, or even learning to say sorry and please and thank you counts as disciplining them. I understand why that would be confusing though--semantics or whatever.

429,Parenthood 리뷰,"For context, I really enjoy The Sims 4 despite having grown up with The Sims 3. Almost every piece of DLC I own was either bundled or bought on sale.

Parenthood is a really great pack, imo. It deepens gameplay in ways we've not really seen in previous entries in the series, and does so logically. The mechanics make sense, and provide a sense of accomplishment. Essentially, children and teens have five meters that increase or decrease depending on their actions or the actions of the parent. Increasing them sufficiently awards a positive trait upon entering adulthood, while decreasing them sufficiently awards them a negative trait. These values can be raised and lowered by various interactions, but will most often be affected by calls the parent(s) receive while the child is at school. The situation varies wildly, but most of the solutions you as a parent can come up with will affect the Empathy trait, more often than not lowering it.

You as a parent also have access to the parenting skill, which allows for better understanding of how to parent your sim children, along with extra interactions between parents and children.

And lastly, phases and mood swings are added to the game. Children will enter phases like Picky Eater, or the dreaded Bear phase, in which theyll constantly wear a bear costume. Off putting? Absolutely. Inconvenient? Perhaps. Realistic? You better believe it. Teens will have mood swings as well. These are always negative moods and carry a hefty +50 effect, so you will never be able to replace them until they wear off.

PROS:

- New skill: parenting

- deeper interactions between parents and children

- extremely rewarding traits are given to sim children depending on how you raise them

- unique teaching opportunities to greatly affect your child's development

- some of the trait values are easy to raise by simple, everyday tasks like doing homework or cleaning dishes

- really nice CAS and build items

- parenting skill makes interacting with toddlers and babies MUCH easier

- phases are oddly charming, and often realistic

- played extensively, have not encountered any pack-specific bugs to my knowledge in a mid-tier PC (AMD Ryzen 5, Nvidia GTX 1660Ti, 16gb RAM, 1TB SSD)


CONS:

- about three of the five trait values are extremely difficult to raise (conflict resolution, empathy, and manners) and easily fall, especially during teen years.

- parenting skill most often affects how discipline is given, and if you have free will turned off or just have sims with mostly positive traits, this is largely useless

- mood swings are common and can be deeply annoying. this makes sense though, so i'm not sure if this even a real drawback or just a healthy dose of realism

- parenting aspirations are difficult to complete, as at least one involves entering ""full parent mode"", which can only be entered by performing several disciplinary interactions in a row. if your sim children are decently behaved, you have to make them perform bad actions yourself, which lowers those trait values, just so your sim can have a shot at entering full parent mode. super weird

- those phone calls from school get reeeeeeeeeal old reeeeeeeal fast, as they often ruin your progress and effort towards raising trait value. The hits are enormous as well, and will instantly drop them out of range of getting the according trait.

- have a child with a trait value in range of receiving a trait does NOT affect gameplay until they become a young adult. you have to completely raise them from child to adult to actual reap any rewards.

Overall an excellent pack that could've benefited from a little deeper thought and planning, as some of the design choices do not equate to fun, and only cause frustration. As always, buy on sale.",Recommended

EA如果不懂怎么做海报可以不做 懂吗？大过年的恶心人
We're happy to celebrate our most important festival with the world TOGETHER, but that doesn't mean that @thesims could represent the festival only by korean and show no respect to its original Chinese culture. Korean also celebrate Christmas, why not representing Christmas by them？The post celebrates lunar new year of tiger with korean costumes and Chinese dishes, deliberately mixing two culture. This is cultural appropriation and offending Chinese players.
I love this game very much , played it almost 800+h but as a Chinese player this is unacceptable.I hope EA team could respect all the players. If you don't know how to represent other’s culture properly at least google it before posting.",Not Recommended

438,Parenthood 리뷰,"I've raised 3 child sims under this pack. Right off the bat, this is not a game pack, it is an overpriced stuff pack. It adds a few dialogue options and a couple of okay items, but overall it doesn't really add ♥♥♥♥ to the game. Your sims can raise the new Parenting skill which is absolutely worthless outside of raising newborn babies. Your children can earn special new traits, which are the only saving grace in this pack because they can help sims deal with conflicts, negative emotions, and other stuff. This sounds more impressive than it actually is.

Overall, I'd say avoid this pack.",Not Recommended

443,Parenthood 리뷰,"As usual EA just leaves bugs and much needed AI fixes. A horrible developer. When you pick up a toddler or a pet, you can't place them in a specific location because the parent or owner will just set them down. So you can't bring your toddler anywhere. It just automatically will pick up the toddler and place them down, defeating the purpose of the pickup option. Then when you're feeding your toddler, a parent will interupt and take them out of the feeding chair, placing them onto the ground before they could finish eating. There's also a bug where the parent repeatedly will pick up the toddler and put them down, and it loops.

But otherwise parenthood is probably one of their best packs. There's just annoying bugs.",Not Recommended

These should've been already a part of the base game, oh well. There are a lot of new interactions and ways to raise your Sims' kids. If you raise toddlers/kids without this pack, it feels a little empty. This pack just adds more drama and color to your family.

If you don't like playing families or raising kids, skip this one and look for other packs that suit your game play.

Buy it during a sale.",Recommended
448,Parenthood 리뷰,"This pack is a huge mixed bag - It's one of the more community popular packs, and for a decent reason, but this is one of the few that I have considered disabling (and I own all current packs). I have about half of the functions of this pack disabled through mods, and if not for the mods I think I would simply disable the pack as a whole.

The reason this pack is popular is that the Character Values add a lot to playing toddler/child Sims, and the traits do add a decent bit to adult Sims (some of which is fairly powerful). Also, the added interactions between toddlers/children and their friends/siblings/parents are really cute - Though I find them to be too few.

As much as this pack is for people who like playing children, it also feels like it was designed with a lot of hate for children and teens. Children have 'phases', and at first some people call them ""kind of cute"", but very quickly they get intensely annoying - Particularly the dreaded 'bear phase'. They are also buggy, and your Sim child can get stuck in these phases.
Teens have mood swings, and they are an overwhelmingly negative take on teenage years as a whole. They are unavoidable, and give you a +50 moodlet for NEGATIVE emotions ONLY. These will show up almost every day when your Teen comes home from school (even with maxed emotional control). There are ways to make them go away quickly (talk about it with parent, talk to self in mirror, etc), but that's not the problem.
Children and Teens have a ""decision"" dialogue box that pops up a ton, where they'll ""Ask Advice"" to a parent, and their character values take a big plus and minus hit to two different values. These are annoying if you *don't* care about their character values, because they happen a lot. These are dreadful if you do care about character values, because whichever value gets the negative hit it's BIG and will be knocked out of trait range.
The parenting skill is a good idea, parenting is a skill. But the way it is implemented falls short in a lot of ways - like who a Sim can raise this skill with. However, I find the skill concerning for having a lot of negative parenting; It is mostly about punishments and ordering children around.",Not Recommended

465,Vampires 리뷰,"I like this Pack and the ideas presented here .
However there are some problems I hope they could fix:
Some of the abilities are too lackluster for example : Command , maybe you could command them to give you money or to steal from another sim.
Or to use the command ability to make gathering collectibles easier for example:
command a sim to fish or look fro frogs or look for minerals etc
it would be great if the influence emotions ability could toggle to also work on the sim casting it.
There is basically no difference i could see between turn to bat (Cost 2 Knowledge) and turn to mist (Cost 6 Knowledge)
for role-play purposes I wish they add a blood type preference to the likes and dislikes list.
the weaknesses are either too crippling or too inconsequential .
eternal sadness makes your sim sometimes have +50 sadness which completely cripples them if it was not dealt with.
Thin skin makes it very risky to send a sim to work since after they get back from work they like to stand still for a few minutes under the sun
On the other hand Day Phobia and Guilty Drinker are very easily resolved bay having the Carefree trait

The worst thing about the Pack in my opinion are the aspects
In the Vampire Family Aspect it makes no sense to become good friends with 5 of your offspring while the reward is that your command ability against them can not fail
The Master Vampire and the Good Vampire aspects both have the survive for 20 / 19 days as a Vampire Task which is in my opinion the worst task in the sims 4, it is just there to inflate gameplay time",Recommended

Gives a different vibe to the game, I am a little sad the new neighborhood that comes with it is so small (only has like 4 or 5 plots) but otherwise it's a pretty cool addition and the vampire theme is really done well.

Yeah, it sucks that Werewolves and Realm of Magic are separate. Yeah, EA loves money too much. Yeah, the Sims as a franchise loves to milk their players.

That said, this is one of my favorite packs in the game, and if you're gonna give EA your money on any pack, this is the one I'd recommend the most, to the point that I'd recommend it over some of the expansions. It adds a neighborhood, albeit a small one, a lot of items, and a decent number of clothes and hairstyles.

Most importantly, the vampire lifestate itself. Honestly, I think this version of vampire sims is way better than what you got in The Sims 2 and The Sims 3 vampire expansions. The leveling with the skill tree is an interesting addition, as is having to decide what weaknesses your vampires will have as you progress.

518,Vampires 리뷰,"Vampire skills are mostly what you can achieve with the aspiration/satisfaction points for regular Sims and the ones that are 'new' are usually game breaking. Half the time when I try to use a vampire skill on another Sim, the whole thing simply freezes up and even trying to use a cheat to reset the Sim doesn't work, so I have to shut down the entire game without saving. If I use the skills to influence moods, even to have the sims around me simply be happy, they usually die (ah, yes, death from being way too happy). This makes the vampire skills useless. Worse, you have to choose weaknesses to go along with the skills and those are annoying and turn your vampire Sim into a mopey, starving mess ALL of the time. Vampire Sim ""dark forms"" are usually hideous and my Sims often get stuck in that form with no way to change back, no matter how many times I click the option to change back. On top of that, people automatically, randomly hate my vampire Sims (even more than they randomly hate my regular Sims) even if they aren't doing anything vampire-like and even if they have the 'skill' to make themselves more attractive. I feel like nothing in this pack actually works and I've wound up changing all of my vampire Sims back to regular Sims over the course of gameplay because it just isn't fun to manage them and it isn't fun to deal with the freezing up all of the time and the random mood deaths. The only positives are that I do like the 5 female hairstyles in this pack and some of the gothic building and plant options. Was that worth $20, though? No.",Not Recommended
519,Vampires 리뷰,"Good for Goth Emo chicks

Not worth the money, even on sale I feel like the Paranormal expansion pack is leagues a head of Vampires, it honestly should have been one pack, another scandalous money milking ploy by EA but i digress. The costumes are cool if you're into 1800s type of fashion, the building decor isn't anything to rave about if you aren't an avid builder of Gothic castles and the game play is kind of dumb. Very bland if you dont have the Extreme Violence mod, like who'd want to be a vampire, live for thousands of years and not commit at least a few murders and robberies in style?

a fun dlc which adds alot
was one of the first i bought but was well worth it
the vampire content is fun especially the perks you get personal favourite is the vampiric sprint makes getting around so much easier
the town that it adds is small with very few places to build but a safe haven for all your vampires
the clothes are super cool same with the build options i especially love the floor options
its one of the better dlc for the game in my opinion",Recommended

554,Vampires 리뷰,"For context, I really enjoy The Sims 4, coming off of being a The Sims 3 fan. All DLC I own has been bought on sale, save for a few stuff packs.

Truth be told, I did not expect much out of this game pack. Vamps in TS3 always felt kind of bare bones so I didn't expect much out of this, but bought it based off of recommendations. I gotta say, a little bit blown away.

I've thoroughly played through the pack's content and there's a lot of meat on these bones. Easily one of the best game packs for TS4, and I'd even venture to say it outclasses some of the expansion packs.

PROS:

- New life state, the vampire. Obviously.

- Vampires actually have a progression system that allows you to develop their powers and further customize and control their lives in unique ways (the ability to put others to sleep, reproduce, more efficient use of powers, can enter any house uninvited, super strength, super speed, bat transformation, sun resistance, etc.) This progression system is simple enough to be intuitive, and complex enough to fun and interesting across several sims.

- Weaknesses must be taken to progress through the vampire ranks, creating a nice balance between advantages and drawbacks so it's not a super obvious choice to make every sim a vamp (occasional hissing, feelings of guilt when feeding on someone, less efficient sleep, sun weakness, less efficient feeding, unable to eat normal food, can only sleep in coffins, etc.)

- LOADS of create-a-sim items that are extremely fitting for vampire, punk, and goth styles

- Even more build items that allow you to make a proper gothic home

- Build items genuinely affect gameplay and serve purposes outside of cosmetics (namely, a vampire will sleep better in a coffin)

- Vamps have ""dark forms"" they can transform into when using powers or feeding. These can be customized to some degree during create-a-sim and have their own outfits, teeth, ears, skin details, eye colors, and skin tones.

- Vampirism completely halts aging, allowing a favorite sim some extra time on the earth

- Vampirism can be hereditary

- New aspirations that play into what type of person your sim is as a vamp, allowing for deeper roleplay and story crafting

- Immersively learning lore on vampires in game, deepening your sim's knowledge and abilities via the Vampire Lore skill

- New plants, consumables, and recipes for vamps including plasma fruit, plasma juice, sun resistance potion, etc.

- New world--Forgotten Hollow--which has unique benefits for vamps.

- Easy curing of vampirism via a bar

- New sims, one of which is heavily based on the titular character from the 1922 horror classic, Nosferatu.

- New interactions based around vampirism and its various tropes both for regular sims (praise vampire lifestyle, confess fear of vampires, debate existence of vampires, ask to turn, etc.) and vampires (compare to long-lost love, declare eternal love, compliment neck, offer to turn, etc.)

- Immersive introduction of the mechanic. Vampires can invite you over and ask if you would like to be turned.

- extensively played, no bugs unique to this pack encountered personally

CONS:

- Somewhat poor communication regarding the affects and usefulness of some powers or weaknesses (taking sun weakness makes daytime travel basically impossible even at the lowest levels)

- Progression through the last ranks of vampirism takes much longer than expected and can easily make the game feel slow

- Vampirism has little to no affects on sims before becoming a teenager

- Force feeding on a sim automatically lowers relationships with all nearby sims, even if you put them to sleep prior to the forced feeding, and regardless of whether or not other sims in your household do the same. Preposterous.

Create-a-sim items are a bit niche, and have few applications outside of the obvious vampiric, gothic, and punk vibes

Overall an extremely solid pack with tons of gameplay potential. Obviously I never recommend giving EA more money then you can get away with, but a rare instance where $20 is a fair price. To me at least.",Recommended

578,Vampires 리뷰,"Fangs Out - Intricate Powers System Makes The Sims™ 4 Vampires Feel Full And Satisfying

Sure, a lot of people may feel a shame how this supernatural game pack does not include werewolves, zombies and faeries just like how the old The Sims 3: Supernatural - but hey, this pack does Vampires right.

The best part about The Sims™ 4 Vampires is the intricate skill and power points plan. This isn’t a life state where you can play out in one session. Balancing out powers with strict weaknesses also puts constraints on the life state – which is a wise challenge to preserve the balance of the game; otherwise it would be a godly force ruling over the game.

The most important factor is Vampire energy, which is decreased by using powers and soaking up the sun. Unless you are a Grand Master with Sun Resistance, vampires cannot go outside for more than few moments in daytime - and no, I am not even exaggerating. If the Vampire energy bar is low, your Vampire will die in the blink of an eye, especially if you chose the ‘thin skinned’ weakness. Amazing, isn’t it?

The power points menu is almost like something that test your strategic foresight ability to think about the cause and effect when choosing the vampire powers and weaknesses. The list of abilities are a great mix between classic supernatural and superhero, appealing to both audiences. The smooth animations, such as superhuman speed, strength and teleportation, are straight-up finesse.

Not to mention, I was also pleasantly surprised by how we are able to create a human disguise (light and dark form) for our vampire in CAS. The vampire eyebrows, ears, scarring, skin tones, teeth and facial structures are also realistically impressive. Moreover, there are three new aspirations and lot traits – the one that leave me the most impression is the ‘Good Vampire’ aspiration since it provides a little challenge for the immortal who want to resist sucking plasma out of innocent Sims. With the new Vampire lair lot trait, your household will even receive gifts from a secret occult organization.

Overall, is definitely a substantial pack that is beautifully well done. It really bring upon generous amount of content that adds tons of depth into gameplay, even if you are not the biggest fan of Vampire.",Recommended

This pack offers a new neighborhood, an entirely new way to play, crazy powers and perks, the entire game is changed as a vampire. I found that this pack goes especially well with City Living, because living in an apartment allows your vampire sim to nearly avoid sunlight, which is very important at the start. As you progress, you can basically become a god among sims.

Pros:
- Ability to create your own style of vampires. Perks and weaknesses allow you to customize your vampires. You can create daywalkers who enjoy the occasional non-plasma food or heliophobic monsters who are feared and hated by the other sims.
- Vampire sims are actually immortal. Unlike in Sims 3 where you need to purchase a lifetime reward for immortality, Sims 4 vampires neither age nor sparkle under the sun.

Cons:
- Severe lack of vampiric cuisine. There's only one vampiric dish that you can make. If you select Withered Stomach as a weakness for one of your sims, the cooking skill becomes worthless.
- Lack of vampiric clothing and objects.",Recommended

590,Vampires 리뷰,"Steam is empty of reviews, so here we are with the rather intriguing Vampire pack - Wondering whether or not its worth the the time or money.

Good news! It's certainly worth the time, and occasionally worth the money!

As an outline of things that the Vampire pack adds, we'll go through a checklist below:

- Gothic Architecture
- Expensive Dental Patients with poor blood retention.
- The ability to **** as a bat.
- Coffins for your millenial sims.
- Immortality!
- Whacky Vampiric spells and forms
- And More!

So the pack adds your favorite hickey fans to the game, along with a talent tree to work your sim through. The gameplay loop as a bloodsucker is a shakeup from the norm, with death looming around every sunrise if you aren't careful. With a plethora of lore, spells, and interactions to choose from the pack seems to set itself apart as something more worthwhile.

That being said, the best part of this is the ability to overcome age and the at times taxing needs of your sims. No longer do you need to worry about re-training the perfect writer as your previous has passed from old age. Nor need you worry about consistently finding a potion of youth. It's quite a time to be un-alive.

Unique pack interactions exist with Seasons, allowing you to go out on rainy, cloudy, snowing days.

Ultimately, I recommend this pack for what it offers. If you can nab it at 50% or more off, awesome! If you've got the spare change and want a toothy transformation for your gameplay, pick it up full price! This is one of the rare ones where I think $20 is fair for what's offered.",Recommended

Bbs are obviously all luxurious stuff, it's good to make a fancy and large mansion, or else it's quite meh for normal life. Actor career is amazing, I love how u can choose the work yourself and then you need to have certain skills to pass the audition and then practice the skill before going to work.

605,Get Famous 리뷰,"The reason I got this pack in the first place was that I had a sim who was chef, and I wanted them to be famous. When I ended up getting this pack, I barely used it at all. It doesn't feel like there's a lot of stuff in CAS, and a lot of the stuff in it I barely use, though I do like the scars, I don't use them often and the werewolf scars are better. and for the hairs, I really like the stuck up-ponytail, but I wish it was just a normal hairband Instead of a fancy metal one. the other hairs I feel like look nice, but are too bold for me to use. And the build stuff I really hate and it feels like there's nothing there since I NEVER use any of it. And the world Is HORRIBLE its so tiny and it doesn't have any special lore in it. ): And the houses are also very badly made.
Though I feel like the aesthetic of the world is nice, you can't really do anything in it other then scream at lots of celebrity's and harass pigeons. And the actor career I don't use often, though it's actually quite fun, I feel like I have to go out of my way to play with it. Fame Isn't very interesting and is honestly even annoying, and reputation doesn't really change your gameplay very much.

One thing I HATE, about this is, if you have two sims who are related to one another, and both are actors/actresses, they will do romance scenes w/ eachother if they are in different house holds. I have two sims who are siblings, and one of them moved out to their own house. Since they both are actors for their job, they do romantic scenes together. Hopefully they can fix that",Recommended

The clothes, accessories, and hair options are awesome. The Fame Quirks are hilarious, and the Perks make things more interesting. My only complaints are the difficulty of interacting with celebrities (like I get you can't just go up and strike up a conversation with a celebrity in real life either, but there should be an option to get to that point faster), and the amount of phone calls and texts goes through the roof. NPCs are constantly blowing up my Sims' phones, asking about how they became friends with a famous Sim that is another household member. But overall, I definitely recommend this pack!",Recommended

For the little I was able to play before it crashed my game it doesn't seem to have any really interesting content in my opinion. I love the sims though but I should have definitely got a different DLC.,Not Recommended
632,Get Famous 리뷰,"For context, I sincerely enjoy The Sims 4, coming from being a Sims 3 fan. All DLC I own was bought on sale, save for a couple of Stuff packs and the Kits, which never go no sale. Most steam reviews are jokes or just complaints and dogpiling, so I'm doing my best to present the pack for exactly what it is.

Get Famous is a pack I overall really like, but do have some very mixed feelings on when it comes to specifics. IIRC this was one of the first packs they released and, imo, one of the better ones, especially when compared to the likes of Discover University, Snowy Escape, and others. Compared to it's Sims 3 equivalent, Late Night, I'd honestly say it holds up pretty decently, as the mechanics and features are deeper, though there are less of them.

At the end of the day, this is a pack that focuses on getting famous. Sims can find careers in acting (which is actually played through or treated like a rabbit hole per your choice, and is a goaled event, meaning you actually have to complete certain objectives to have a productive day), or perform actions that net them fame. Fame works similarly to vampirism and spellcasting, in that fame allows you to ascend celebrity ranks, unlocking perks that directly play into what kind of celebrity your sim is and what their reputation is like. Reputation, by the way, unlocks tons of interactions and opportunities, and easily lands you in with particular crowds that have similar reputations, which is something I find many people do not comment on. This is an instance where The Sims 4 has equal or greater depth in its mechanics than previous games--there are actual consequences for every day actions. Being mean, rude, or doing harmful things to others directly impacts your reputation and affects what opportunities are offered to your sim.

PROS:

- A fame mechanic that actually makes sense and must be maintained--failing to acquire more fame will lead to your sim fading into obscurity and losing out on any perks

- A perk chart that allows for customization for what kind of celebrity your sim is. Obviously a famous actor will have different perks than a famous youtuber or painter, and the game reflects this

- Fame is fairly easy to come by and there are more than enough ways to obtain it, however it does require work and will not just be casually maxed out without effort, unlike The Sims 3.

- Acting careers are fun and have more depth than expected--sims must have relevant skills and experience to not only win a role, but to ace it. Every acting gig begins with hair and makeup, wardrobe, practicing scenes, and then actually performing those scenes in front of a camera. Each scene has an option for a ""safe"" or ""risky"" version. The safe one is adequate, but the risky goes over better, provided you stick the landing.

- A plethora of CAS and build items that stand on their own and compliment other packs, often catered towards well-off sims that can afford the finer things in life.

- Extensively played and very few bugs encountered, if any at all, on a midgrade PC (AMD Ryzen 5, GTX 1660Ti, 16gb RAM, 1tb SSD).

- A plethora pf details with skills and interactions means that you can hear and see when a sim improves their acting ability

- Sims that max out fame get to place a star on the walk of fame in the new neighborhood, Del Sol Valley

- Reputation plays directly into how your sim is percieved by others. A negative rep will mean your sim is met with boos, while a positive rep means your sims will be cheered on and offered unique opportunities.

- Sims can now store their money in a vault, which has different interactions based on how much money is inside.

- New trait, Self-Absorbed

- Blind dates

- The ability to give residence keys to other sims


CONS:

- Fame deteriorates extremely quickly. I'm not sure if it deteriorates faster at lower levels, but it really is insane how quickly it goes down. Luckily fame is easy enough to come by.

- Lack of tutorialization or proper UI means that it is sometimes hard to tell exactly how prepared your sim is for an acting role, or how they should prepare.

- Fame quirks are extremely easy to get and result from just a few interactions, meaning you can acquire a quirk that does not at all fit your sim simply because you texted a friend, or chose to practice acting. These can be wiped away for a fee, but ultimately are too common or numerous to stay on top of.

- Acting pays fairly low, even at the higher levels of the career, and takes too long. First you must audition for the gig, which is always scheduled for the next day. Then you must pass the audition. If you do, you will then have one to two days before the gig itself, which lasts exactly one day. Then another job must be found. It would make more sense if the payout were slightly larger, or if the sim acquired royalties from the role in addition to the big payout, since most celebrities make money off of ticket sales when a movie hits theaters.

- Acting as a career is difficult to juggle when there is more than one sim in your household, as the only way to ensure your sims does well is to play through the actual work day, which means abandoning your other sims to the AI.


Overall, Get Famous earns a high recommendation from me. It's fun, adds enough content to justify being its own pack, and has depth many do not give it credit for. As usual, though, only buy on sale. You cannot expect packs to be high quality if you buy all of them on release.",Recommended

Without it, your sim won't get too far. You can just stand in front of a mirror and get all your acting skills but it's not fun that way. The night clubs and bars are your best friend for interactions. When you start your acting career, to get better, you have to interaction and befriend other actors and directors so that your skills will go up. Once that is accomplished, and you take the job, you go to the studio and do your part. It's fairly easy. Money is easily made. By no time, you'll be owning that house that overlooks the city.

650,Get Famous 리뷰,"This is possibly my favorite of the Sims 4 expansion packs that I've played so far. The acting career is amazing! You feel like you're part of the world. Sims can get famous from doing almost anything, given your fame perks are in the right places. The more famous you become, the more disconnected from the little sims you become. Then you have to wear a disguise in public, you can't go on dates anymore because sims will crowd you wherever you go. This pack meshes well with Discover University because you can earn more with a degree in Drama.

My largest complaint about this pack is that you can see the ocean but can't go to it. Also I kinda wish that the ""Hottest spot in town"" would be more than just a club for me and like 3 other celebrities to sit and do nothing.

Other than that, I love this pack! You can move into large houses, buy a safe and save millions of dollars, and be a big celebrity and make your enemies cry!",Recommended

653,Get Famous 리뷰,"The fame system is pretty interesting, the traits let you customize what kind of famous your Sim is. I like Sims 4's fame system better than Sims 3's fame system, because Sims 4's fame system is more about your Sim actually *doing* something that other people will see and recognize - Art, music, writing, etc. (Sims 3's fame was all about who you know, and you could have utterly unremarkable Sims that were inexplicably famous.) The skills/actions that contribute to fame are really robust, and of course there is the important settings option to turn off fame for your household. (I wish more expansions had settings included to disable things, rather than needing mods to control them!)

Compared to other expansions, I would rate this as middling. It's a good expansion, not one of the ones with a lot of flub, but there are definitely others that are going to add more to your game. (Unless your #1 favorite thing is just being famous!)",Recommended

On the plus side, you can build pools now, how long did it take them to do something that was in Sims 3? Bought at winter sale for just under $20 plus the base game under $5. Does EA even realize how annoying they are? If you have been annoyed by EA before, they continue to annoy. Day 2 of work, character is still at work, can't do some things because he is ""at work"". Origin ""helped"" me by adding other content I had to my steam account. Thank you, EA/Origin. I was trying to test out a combination that was not polluted. My Fame star is fading because my character cannot do things to keep him relevant. because he is AT WORK! Character is grayed out even though being clearly at home. I promised I would not give EA any more money but here I am, suckered in again. Will start again without their stupid bonus builds.

Well, I have definitely played this for hours and no time recorded yet. Sad. When you start the game for the first time, it asks for your Origin ID and password, well, I entered that and the game ""helped"" me by melding my Origin information. My intention was to buy the base game and play Get Famous as a standalone, thanks EA, ever helpful. How about a warning, or an option to include specific DLC content and I am not sure what it included but I have saved games from my Origin account that are available.

To answer the question, I think you need an Origin account, I got asked to login after about 10 hours of play and I had checked ""keep me logged in"" for my login credentials. Way to go, EA. Is there another company that does this? Back in the 1980's , companies became concerned about piracy , so they put in copy protection which made the floppies sort of self destruct and encouraged people to write code to copy and create a clean disc free of the copy protection. I love abuse, so I will continue playing. I could probably fill a notebook with observed bugs but isn't that what they hire their QA department to do?

668,모두함께 놀아요 리뷰,"Welcome to Windenburg, where the local time is 1996.

Cliquey clubbing, everyone trying to be a DJ, weird dancing, terrible fashion, Cream, Ministry, and those funny little bars that couldn't decide if they were a pub or a club. They're all in this pack. Oh and coffee shops are here, as well, as they should be.

The 'Get Together' element of the pack involves the ability to get up to eight Sims at one venue, potentially doing the same thing as part of a group. This mechanic is now in the base game, so it won't be new to you. What these gatherings do add is the ability to earn and apply buffs that affect mood or the speed at which designated skills are earned. So, for example, you can meet at the Onsen for a snowboarding sesh, with a buff that allows the Sims in the group to learn snowboarding skills faster. Actually, they'll all be chillin' in the onsen and absolutely no slopes get tackled unless you continually direct them, but you get the drift. At a residential venue Sims do seem to be more motivated to take part in actual club activities, so you can make a family group that gains points for cleaning, gardening, repairing and cooking, and spend those points on buffs that grant accelerated skill learning. That's a lot of Sims talking to plants while one learns to play the violin in an afternoon (with mentoring and a buff, it's possible!).

I've hit the 'recommend' option, but actually this pack is the first one I've considered uninstalling. Why? Well, it's just so woohootastic that the gameplay has become a bit flat.

Back in base game, getting a date with Mitchell Kalani wasn't exactly tricky, but it took some effort. You had to impress Mitchell before he'd impress you back. In contrast, talking with Candy Behr can go from flirty introduction to woohooing in the closet in maybe five interactions, and that's with a newly minted adult sim with low Charisma. No disastrous, hilarious dates or flat rejections to savour here. It's not just Candy. They all seem to be equally easily pleased. Where's the fun in that?

If that's exactly where the fun is, and your gameplay is focused on the woohoo, this is the pack for you. Not only does it seem to make it easier in terms of fewer interactions, the game has also given you new ways to daze prospective victims, and new locations to drag them. Maybe I'm just too old and jaded to be enthused by easily available WooHoo. Though, it is 1996, and to be honest that's how it was. Dance on Friday, get happy, get sloppy, stop at a cafe for a cup of tea on the way home, spend Sunday in regret and mild panic, come up smiling on Monday. This pack gives your Sims that authentic experience.

The pack has added some glorious animations (like it always does) in the dancing (there are dance battles and group dancing to enjoy too). The DJ skill is a bit lacklustre, and it seems that Sims won't autonomously hit the decks, nor can you designate one of your played characters to work an event like you can with caterers, mixologists and musicians.

The cafe locations add a little variety, and there are more drink options added to the bar, as wel as snacks I've not seen anysim eat. There are also a few more games like babyfoot and darts that your Sims can play, giving more options to build relationships, and of course the animations for these games are wonderful.",Recommended

674,모두함께 놀아요 리뷰,"WARNING!

Before you continue with this review is imperative that you read the following in a loud voice: BUY ON SALE ONLY!

I got to admit I didn't expect to like what this pack does as much as I do. Although a good chunk of my fun comes from mods that help the gameplay added by this pack to do what I need it to do.

CLUBS:

Tired of leveling those incredibly boring child sims' skills? Are you like me, sick that your young adult sim go to a venue to meet people their age and find all the fun places are crowded by those boring adult sims? Or you simply want your sims to do something and not dropping it after 5 seconds to go play biblock or watch comedy on the tv? Fear not! Clubs are the solution you are looking for. Seriously, I made a club for my teen sims and now they can hang out with a bunch of other teens in a venue without fearing a boring older sim come to bother them (thanks to MCCC and it's ability to make clubs for more than the max 8 members). And the children? Once my children-only club got enough points to buy the right perks I can get those child aspirations done in a sim-day or two each, no more inviting the annoying neighbor's child every day for two weeks straight just to have one bff or spending 5 sim-days on the computer practicing typing. And other clubs are great because you can define rules for what they are allowed and, more importantly, not allowed to do, members may still do it but they will be scolded by the other members for breaking the rules and they won't do it again. God I love clubs.

Windenburg:

The new world added. I'll be plain and clear, it is beautiful. Both residential and public venues. If anything, at times it's incredibly empty, but if you have a loner sim (or you the player dislike crowded places, like me) it is perfect.

Others:

New games for your parties. That's rather forgettable, but if you do like to have a bunch of parties they can be good for bonding.

Very cute new CAS clothes and haircuts for females, though I didn't like the new stuff for males. Build mode items are quite good as well.

678,모두함께 놀아요 리뷰,"When I bought the Sims 4 Get Together I didn’t know what to expect going into it. It has evolved into probably my favorite or one of my top three Sims 4 packs ever. The world of Windenburg is gorgeous, and it has a generous amount of lots to play and build on. There is tons of Build Buy content included, much of it being influenced by Northern Europe. There are many great objects for gameplay lovers and builders. A majority of the CAS is nightclub wear. In my opinion the CAS more on the weaker side, so if you really only like making Sims then I don’t really recommend this pack for you. The club system is an absolute blast; you can make nearly anything with it and it has includes cross-pack features from nearly every single pack. There are two new skills, two new traits, and one new aspiration. There is a lot of gameplay pumped into this pack. You can style and pick out other Sims’ outfits. Friends and family will occasionally text you asking to hang out. You can visit cafés and even moonlight at them. Bars occasionally host happy hour and special events. There is so much to do in this pack for everyone, and it took me a long time to finally cover every single feature included. If you are looking for tons of family gameplay this pack probably isn’t for you. This pack revived my game and my Sims hyper-fixation for a long time, it REALLY kept me occupied. I highly suggest this pack. For what it includes I feel the asking price of $40 is actually worth it, but otherwise I really suggest getting it when it’s on sale. Happy Simming!",Recommended
679,모두함께 놀아요 리뷰,"I use this all the time. Not really worth the $50 it's asking, but it's definitely worth half price to me.

Making your own clubs has become one of the most used aspects of gameplay for me.
You can make any sort of club you want, and change the member requirements at any time, as well as the approved and prohibited activities. You can set a specific location as the club hangout location, or set a ""type"" of location, such as ""cafe"".

I've used this for my gold digger sim to find rich elderly people to marry - she started a social club with the requirements of rich (finances above 30,000), and elderly (plus young adult because that's her age). Anyone in the club who no longer fits the requirements will immediately be removed, so if a sim in her club suddenly lost their fortune, the club would immediately weed them out for me.

I also have a household club, with actions such as ""clean"", ""cook"", ""do homework"", ""be friendly"".
You can choose up to 5 approved activities, and up to 5 ""no no"" activities. It helps guide the automation of household and non-household sims who are in an active gathering of a club.

In this way you can have a gardening club who will meet at your house and tend your plants for you (however they will also harvest the plants, which is infuriating to me).

You gain points by doing approved activities, and use these points to buy perks for that club. Perks can include things like; more successful social interactions, improved chances of getting promoted at work, learning skills faster, putting all club members in a specific emotional state (eg confident, flirty, energized), and starting with a higher or lower friendship than usual when you meet a sim for the first time.
You also have perks such as: add more member to the club (for a total of 8 members), set a secret handshake, and special club jackets.

You can also run club gatherings for as long as you want, although NPCs will likely leave when their needs become too low. But the gathering will still be active, so you will still benefit from the skill gain boosts etc.",Recommended

690,모두함께 놀아요 리뷰,"The Good
A pretty exciting and sometimes broken club mechanic. You could do so many things with it!
A big, beautiful new world, although with the same problems as the base game of not being customizable as in the Sims 3.
Many new things that can be done, new ways to take your Sims on adventures. This can be very fun and fulfilling if you set up your clubs properly.
The Okay
Surprisingly, there are not many bugs that I have encountered with this pack, although it still has its fair share.
New WooHoo and closet features included - they are pretty standard across packs and this one does not feel extra special.

If you're looking to take your Sims on a club adventure, then wait for a (at least 30%) sale and get it - you'll feel pretty thrilled with it and the possibilities that clubs can bring. The only problem: clubs (and possibly the new world) are basically the only big thing that you can get from this pack. The rest is just extra bluff. Nonetheless, it can be an entertaining addition, so I would recommend it during a pack sale.",Recommended
691,모두함께 놀아요 리뷰,"I want to give a proper review of this pack since there doesn't seem to be much talk about the different uses for the clubs system. If you enjoy long-term gameplay and storylines like me, this pack is essential. I've seen mixed reviews about the clubs system, but I actually consider it to be a great feature. It has a decent amount of customization that allows you to use it in a few different ways:

Practicality
Clubs can make routines like housechores, homework, or skill-building easier, since members will autonomously go do that stuff. Or, if you want to build a painting moneymaking machine off the backs of your slaves fellow club members, you can do stuff like that too.


You can make clubs that represent the different friend groups/ factions in your gameplay. It's especially useful when you have a lot of different sims/ relationships to manage.


Clubs can gather autonomously at certain venues (whatever's set in their settings), even if you aren't currently controlling anyone in that club. Want to see a group of shabby-looking drunkards meeting up at the local bar? How about a group of wealthy Snobs that go to museums and judge other people's work? Or maybe you want a group of vampires that autonomously hunts sims down and cause general mayhem? Want to turn all lounge venues into a fighting warzone between two opposing factions? You can do that too. Autonomous clubs can really put some life into otherwise generic venues.


Other than the clubs system, I love the build and CAS items, and Windenburg is definitely my favorite town. Highly recommend this pack if you play TS4 with storylines--ESPECIALLY for long-term. That being said, only buy it on sale, $40 is a rip-off for any Sims 4 DLC.",Recommended

697,모두함께 놀아요 리뷰,"Over 1800 hours into Sims 4 and owning all the available DLC's, this is my take:

If you just got into Sims 4, I would recommend getting 2 Expansion Packs first rather than the other ones. They are City Living and this one: Get Together. But if you don't care too much about lots, then get the Seasons DLC along with Get Together because the snow is just awesome with this town.

This Expansion Pack literally packs ALOT. Watch the youtube vids. Read the reviews. There's so much to unload in this pack. Windenburg, the town/plaza is probably the best looking out of all the DLC's. Reading the reviews on here, I noticed people are focus on the activities and things to do rather than building things. I think this DLC has the best building items, even more so than the Cottage pack etc. Therefore you can spend weeks or even months building your town. There's a good amount of Lots too. IMO this DLC is on par with the City Living Pack as far as the activities go. Actually, the Get Together DLC works so well with the City Living DLC because both have great night life activities. Set clubs up for both those DLC's like clubbing, dancing, singing etc.

There are cool small details too. This DLC also has great music to your game.",Recommended
698,모두함께 놀아요 리뷰,"Seriously underrated. While the clubs are not my favorite, the world and characters are all great. There's a lot of fun variety and story telling here, and the WORLD.

THE WORLD IS HUGE. I ended up redoing a whole neighborhood and moving characters into different areas to make way for custom, new sims that I made. There is so much room to play here.

The clubs are basic. It won't feel like a real addition to the game because it just harnesses old gameplay and the clubs are very small, but they definitely can be used to your advantage if you design one well. It is helpful to dictate how other sims act sometimes, and I could see this adding a lot to teen/child gameplay.",Recommended

I'd already played every expansion pack up to the release of Cottage Living and played a good chunk of them. It turns out that this pack is really good. Dancing has been expanded, so it's a skill now. You can be DJ, however, I was disappointed that it was not a career. It really doesn't pay well, from what I've seen so far. I think it would've made an interesting job, and this pack doesn't even include any new careers. This pack mostly focuses on hanging out and doing fun things with other sims, as the name implies. You can turn lots into nightclubs, club hangouts, coffee bars, etc. There's even a giant haunted maze in the new town of Windenburg. Being a club leader is pretty fun. You customize how everyone looks, what skills are boosted during gatherings, who to kick out, who to accept, make the rules, etc.

The neighborhood map is nice though [fancy, lots of social stuff].",Not Recommended
710,모두함께 놀아요 리뷰,"This has to be my favourite pack, just for the map and the variety of build&buy objects. I swear, the map is stunning with many building spots (including 2 massive ones).
There’s an island with 4 or 5 lots and many fishing spots with beautiful sights. It’s like semi-open. It might challenge your building style, it’s fun. The map also has a more rural Irish/Scottish/Bretagne set of lots. Finally, you have the downtown part that could be typical of France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland... depending on how you build it. It’s very good to have something that doesn’t have an average north american suburbia vibe.

As for the gameplay, the club feature is a little underwhelming. Paired with City Living/University/Get Famous, it could be nice. Otherwise it’s just « painting club », « fishing club », « dancing club ». I’ve seen youtube walkthroughs that show how the clubs can lead to funny rivalry moments. But it doesn’t happen unless you focus your gameplay on clubs for a good while.

Is it worth €40? No. None of the Sims 4 is worth that much money, in my opinion. Wait for a discount to get this nice pack for half the price.",Recommended

The Sims Team have really outdone themselves this time with this pack! This breathtaking world of Windenburg introduced seven new neighborhoods. Every one of these seven neighborhoods has its own beauty and charm!

The Old Town is a mixture of venues and residential lots. It features some beautiful landmarks such as the chess garden area and a huge sculpture of what appears to be the founder of the Old Town. The modern Business District is filled with fountains and attractive venues such as the Nightclub, The Gym, The Cafe and The Pool Venue. The Rural Neighborhood has more beautiful and attractive areas which include fishing spots, a windmill, and other magical areas that I will leave up to you to discover. The Island is an isolated neighborhood. It is surrounded by another island that your Sim can also visit; the Island Bluff. The addition of the woohoo bush in the center of the island was a nice touch and makes it a great place for your Sims to go on a date and engage in some romance.

brings so much to the game in the ways that I could never imagine it would. I love how your Sim does not need to be always in control of the clubs or to be the instigator for every events. The other sims can contact your Sim out of the blue and invite them out to somewhere and occasionally the text you send to a Sim may lead to an invite out too.

But each piece - Windenburg, Clubs, the various Sim options (traits, clothes), especially the Clubs, the build options - they are all fantastic. Particularly the Clubs, the on-demand friends at all hours are basically OP, and then you get a ton of buffs for calling them over! OP aside, they're an incredibly useful tool to organize Sims friends and social groups, and help make the Sims social lives more cohesive.

The Clubs feature is extremely well made - There are a handful of pre-made clubs your Sims can join, but you can also make your own, and they've done an *amazing* job of including every skill / activity / action in the game, and making sure that everything from packs after this one is included.",Recommended

the university gameplay is actually pretty stressful. I had to turn on long lifespan and use mc command center to tweak the difficulty because i was STRESSED. keep in mind university takes a very long time to complete, i think the fastest you can complete it and get a degree is 3 in game weeks (which is the majority, pretty much all, of the young adult lifestage). the job benefits you get from having a degree are pretty nice though.
one of the main attractions to this pack is the idea of campus life and dorms, which is pretty lackluster in the game. dorms are annoying and you don't even really have a room to yourself because the entire dorm hall are considered your roommates and will walk into your room all the time and like never leave (and your sim will autonomously go to the other rooms to do everything nonstop). you can always lock the doors for everyone but your sim, but then you can't have an actual dorm roommate and you'll have to cheat and remove a bed. Also, societies are kinda fun, but most of the society events you can attend aren't very functional and half of the time what is supposed to be happening will not be happening (ex. art society figure painting event. half the time none of the easels are even set up and you can't set them up yourself.)

The CAS is pretty cute and you can use a lot of it beyond just uni centered gameplay. however, most of the build/buy is very uni centered and don't really work the best outside of decorating a dorm.

one of the best parts of this pack to me is honestly bikes. i LOVE bikes.

this pack is pretty self explanatory and if you think you would like it, you probably will. if you aren't so sure, you probably won't.",Recommended
748,캠퍼스 라이프 리뷰,I like this pack because you have lots of choices. You can choose to work at home or work on campus. Your teen sim can apply to college when near aging up. Your teen sims can apply to college a week before aging up. They can apply to college by just using a computer. Teens can apply for scholarships at any time of their teenage stage. Also you can go to college at any age. Once your teens turn into a young adult they can go to college (If they were accepted into one). There a two types of degrees a distinguished degree and a normal degree. Which degrees is distinguished is different at each college. There are only two colleges. Scholarships your sim can get depend on their skills or household income. You wanna apply to college as soon as you can. Because it takes a couple days to process the college application. Your teen needs to have good grades to get a distinguished degree. If you get a job after you finish college related to your degree it pays more money. And you get a one time bonus once you have the job.,Recommended

My sim attended UBrite which I transformed into a Victorian women's college and it honestly is some of the most fun I had in a while playing the game, I didn't even want my sim to graduate. You can revamp the dorms completely if you wanted with bb.enablefreebuild, and edit each of your roommates to be whatever you want to follow whatever storyline.

Having the Academic Scholar aspiration really livens up the gameplay, and it's actually kinda stressful trying to get a good GPA, trying to complete all your homework and trying to attend all your classes. It all feels extremely thought-out and realistic too, everything from actually applying to the universities to the different degrees.

You can go speak with your professors and take extra classes and tutor student. Be aware, tutoring is an all day/night event.

You better use the build mode before enrolling to the university. Because once your character is in the campus, you won't be able to open the build mode no more. And the place you stay really looks OLD, so you gonna prefer making it more modern and livable in your own kinda way. And no complaints about it;

781,캠퍼스 라이프 리뷰,"For context, I like The Sims 4 quite a lot, coming off being a The Sims 3 fan and every expansion I have has been bought on sale.

As a quick overview, Discover University is exactly what it claims to be--a college-themed EP for The Sims 4. It allows your Sim to go to college, earn a degree, and experience boosts to career levels and money earned. It includes MANY Create-A-Sim items, which I found very satisfying, as that's an area I think most packs fall short in and several new interactions and some extra features beyond the obvious.

Pros:

- Two colleges with different strengths and focuses with a healthy rivalry

- A staggering amount of degrees (art, culinary, engineering, science etc.) and classes that offer more customization for your Uni experience than previous iterations of this expansion, incorporating degree-focused classes and electives

- Completing work assignments for each class steadily improves the respective skills each close is associated with, a feature I do not believe was included with previous iterations of this pack

- New careers

- LOADS of Create-A-Sims clothing options, hairs, and styles, most of which are decent and resemble combinations I've actually seen people wear

- Increased potential for roleplaying and story-crafting

- WooHoo in shower. Finally.

Cons:

- Buggy. And I mean BUGGY. I've played extensively and usually my games run pretty well with only occasional minor bugs with animations or doors. But Discover University is shockingly buggy when it comes to tasks, townies interacting with each other, use of bathrooms, roommates etc.

- Complete and utter lack of tutorials, explanations, communication to the player, and intuitive design means completing classes is often difficult or downright frustrating. You're given homework to complete, just like with normal primary and secondary schooling in the base game, but I completed all the homework regularly and on time and still failed most classes. Turns out you must also study via a computer. But good luck with that because...

- University housing leaves much to be desired and is home to many of the bugs and issues with this pack. You cannot buy items or decorate your dorm or room at all. Any work that must be done on a computer is often difficult to make time for because there's often only one or two for an entire dorm. There's also a complete lack of kitchen appliances, so most food will be quick meals or pizza deliveries. If there's a fix for this or a kitchenette anywhere, I couldn't find it.

- Most college-goers are completely generic, random townies despite the fact that a few NPCs come with the pack. I've seen them around town, but not the university. So good luck meeting friends that don't look like someone brought a toddler's drawing to life.

- A severe lack of things to do when not in class. University Life for The Sims 3 had constant activities, between the science project, gathering hall, and constant parties. Now there are a small handful of events that take place in the university center square, but they're short-lived and offer little to do. I understand this is in part due to the use of loading screens and lack of an open world making events like this somewhat difficult to program, but my god. Horribly boring imo.

- Poor visual design of the campus means the buildings where you go to class are sometimes difficult to find or differentiate from each other. Though I think the same building is reused throughout the campus? It's odd to say the least. But the static buildings that offer nothing are abundant and annoying and make traversing the Universities frustrating.

Final Verdict: Kind of charming, mechanically serves a purpose, but overall poorly designed imo. Fun at times, frustrating the rest, though I'm sure if you get the hang of it the entire process is much smoother. Only buy if you REALLY want the ability to go to college or just want as many CAS items as possible.",Not Recommended

783,캠퍼스 라이프 리뷰,sending my sims to uni so i dont have to go there myself,Recommended
784,캠퍼스 라이프 리뷰,"There are some aspects of this expansion pack that I don't like. For example, (1) there's no stove in ANY of the dorms, only in the social houses. Therefore, if your sims is living in a dorm, you're forced to rely on your roommates making food for you as a group meal, which doesn't always happen every single day. If you have the hardly hungry perk for your sim then you'll be fine. If you don't you'll be in trouble because the other sims sometimes go 2-3 days without making food. And even if they do, said food quickly spoils because other sims are too lazy to put the food in the fridge. I had to use the testing cheats option to build my own stove so I could actually make proper meals for my own sim.

(2) Unlike Sims 3, if you go to university in Sims 4, you have to choose between online learning or attending campus. If you choose to attend school on campus, you're literally forced to give up your home. This is a lesson I learned the hard way. In Sims 3 university pack, you attended the campus with your sim and when your sims graduated, you literally moved back into your old house. This is not an option in Sims 4. So if you want to keep your current home, you have to choose online learning, which makes this part of the expansion pack redundant as the expansion pack is catered towards interacting with your sim and others while on campus. Also, not a deal breaker but in Sims 3 you could invite family and friends to attend your graduation ceremony. This doesn't happen in Sims 4.

(3) Classes aren't as immersive as Sims 3. In Sims 3, there were a few classes where you could control and interact your sim with the environment. Choosing to (or not) to participate in class. This doesn't exist in Sims 4 but it isn't a deal breaker.

Can I recommend this expansion pack? Yes and no. Yes if it's on sale because it's still a cool experience that does affect your career and pay. If this expansion pack is not on sale, then no, it's not worth the $55 EA Games is trying to milk out of you. I bought this game when it was on sale.

791,캠퍼스 라이프 리뷰,"It's pretty dull. You just chug through the process (much like a particularly dull career, with very little variation). It also doesn't really affect careers after - The time spent at the Uni lands you in a career position that you probably would have reached in the time spent at the Uni. Only thing I can say is there's some pretty good CAS stuff.",Not Recommended
792,캠퍼스 라이프 리뷰,"So, for storytelling purposes University has obviously always been pretty big. But uh... Honestly I expected a lot better out of this pack than what's here.

So the rival university thing falls pretty flat, there's not really actual gameplay that pops up about that. The organizations are fixed, no customizing them like the fantastic Clubs from Get Together. The organizations are not terribly interesting, and work a bit clunky, and boot your Sim out as soon as they graduate. My biggest pet peeve about organizations is that they come up first in the social groups tab, so I always have to click past them to get to my FAR more useful clubs. The dorms function like being on vacation, aka no build/buy mode while you live in them - at least you can live at home!

The degrees take a long time to earn. That's not entirely a bad thing, especially if you play on Long lifespan (which I mostly prefer), but on medium lifespan it's a little too long. On short lifespan I don't think it's worth it unless you're planning to make a particular sim immortal. It takes a minimum of 3 weeks to earn a degree, and unlike Sims 3 you can not earn any credits from having high skills (or doing well in high school) towards a degree to shorten it. Unlike Sims 2 where University is a separate life stage, enrolling in university simply becomes available when a Sim reaches young adult, and happens during their normal lifespan. Note that the YA lifespan is 12 days for Short, 24 days for Medium, and 94 days for Long. Your degree will take 21 days with every semester enrolled in the maximum number of classes.
There are a ton of mods that will change various things relating to this, but *as is* it... Well, leaves you wanting mods to fix a design that was not fully considered.

So once you have the degree you do get a pretty nice boost to starting level in related jobs. This does stack with other job level boosts, like the one for being Famous. So if you stack them up Super Sim style you can start really broken high in careers. That said, I do consider every *other* option more powerful. They can be achieved in a shorter amount of time, and mostly before your Sim is even an adult, aaaand they apply to *every* job instead of only a handful. (Most degrees are related to 3-4 jobs, assuming all packs. The most is 6 from Communications, the least is 2 from Culinary Arts. - I do not count Freelancer since they don't have real levels. Some degrees only have 1 job if you have no packs other than Discover University.)

Now, the one thing I do really like from this pack is the Servos. They're a little bit annoying to make, because every robotics part takes forever to make and you need a ton of them - You will likely still be making parts after you max the skill to have enough. They also only have a VERY limited selection of bodies with poor customization. However! You can change their traits freely, and they get an extra mode setting for behavior. They seem to be functionally immortal, and don't have many needs to take care of. Their unique social interactions are pretty good (and useful), and their face expressions for their different emotions are very funny.
Servos are not a super strong life state like Spellcasters or Vampires, but they are a very GOOD life state. They have solid flavor and functions, and will spice up your game. I could call the expansion worthwhile for the Servos if you're into them, however they really can not carry the full price alone - So hold out until a sale.",Not Recommended

Basically, my sims would go to bed then at some point she wakes up, so then I tell my sim to go back to bed. But the first sleeping action stays there with a red X on it. When she wakes up, she doesn't do any of the things I tell her to do - eat, go to class etc. For the amount that you pay, there really shouldn't be any bugs. Also, when you live in a dormitory it gets dirty all the time, it doesn't matter that a maid comes everyday. My sims feel uncomfortable the whole time.
All in all a fun expansion, but they should just fix the bugs.",Recommended

795,캠퍼스 라이프 리뷰,"I have been across the web looking for what many consider to be the best expansion packs to get for Sims 4, and this one was high on several lists. After playing with a lot of the additions to the game from this pack, I have to say it's definitely not the best. Discover University allows you to go to college, live the college life, get a degree, and make significantly more in every full-time career (depending on what your degree is in). They did a really good job simulating the college experience, except for the outrageously cheap tuition and courses that last a week each. However, they did great on the part where the homework contributes almost nothing to your skill level.
There's an entirely new place to explore and new sims to meet. Before enrolling, you will want to get your sim to a high enough skill level in certain areas, in order to apply for a distinguished degree. I like the addition of a bicycle for your sim to get around faster. And yes... you can ""woohoo"" in the shower now.
My biggest complaint about this pack is not the college itself, but rather the careers are absolutely broken! DO NOT become a private attorney, I know on the Sims forum it shows that this career can earn a sim more than 450 simoleans an hour after reaching level 10, but don't do it. Though you could earn a lot, the promotion rate can be significantly less than other jobs due to the outrageous daily task. You have to offer legal representation and obtain new clients. This may sound like a normal task, but I can see having trouble doing this with a outgoing sim. You have to talk to sims (always in person) and offer legal representation. I tried this for about a week and some sadist made it so you lose friendship with sims with every failed attempt (the dumbest thing in this game). For a higher success rate, you have to put lawyer clothes on and have a high friendship with the sim. To top it all off, you have to get about 12 clients in a day. I was able to get 3 in one day and that took 3 hours, after that it said 25% complete.
The Engineering career is one that I recently transitioned over to from being a lawyer. It seems pretty good, it's another career in this pack. Though the robot builder seems pretty broken. It's a fighting match to keep your sim on a single project without automatically leaving and doing something else.
Overall, I'd say the pack is okay. Not the best, but alright. Definitely get it on sale.",Not Recommended

Don't get me wrong. I'm a HUGE sims fan. I have played Sims 1, Sims 2 and Sims 3 and bought every single X-pac and stuff pack for each of them. I've spent literally THOUSANDS of dollars playing the Sims over the years. I still feel Sims 2 was overall the best edition. Sims 3 brought thing I enjoyed but wasn't quite as good. Still, the University pack for Sims 3 (while not as good as for 2) is amazing compared to THIS garbage!

Bottom line: when its RECOMMENDED by the developer (on 3rd party sites) as ""Essential"" to use cheat codes to make an expansion playable, you know something is wrong.

No cooking in the university... no stoves or bar-B-que grills allowed! (seriously)
No computers in the dorm
No way to check grades... You can email the professor and he says ""you are doing fine"" and then you get an F... WTF?

my favorite part? Your dorm roommates will walk into the BATHROOM and literally pull Lobster Thermador out of their A$$ and then bring it out to the central area for people to eat... I'm not joking, they magically make FOOD in the BATHROOM!

807,아일랜드 라이프 리뷰,"This pack is lots of fun. The game first came out with the sim needing mermaid kelp that they could purchase through goal points and now they've open it to also be available when creating your new sim. Being able to interact with dolphins is super cool, but mermaids don't have a lot of powers vs vampires. I'm a huge Ariel fan so the only ups to having a mermaid are the tail decorations, getting mermaid sims to marry and seeing a sims have mermaid fins by birth or 50 50 when they marry a non-merman - mermaid. I wish they could just jump or dive in water from the lake homes they made. I was in sims 3 when they had a huge island filled with many homes and mermaids could dive in deep waters and find neat stuff. You'd even meet a mermaid too. With becoming a vampire, there is a known vampire to be in touch with you to help you make your way to be the vampire you want, but not mermaids and I wish they had something like that. Maybe they'll upgrade the mermaid pack and make it sparkle more, but it's still fun.",Recommended

Anyway, I like mermaids! And beaches! The product succeeded in what it was setting out to do, it gave me both. With this information, hopefully this will help you make your purchase. Some people are disappointed with the lack of new gameplay options mermaids provide, but imo a mermaid does just about everything I want a mermaid to do. But I do wish child sims could be mermaids, so I could have a whole mermaid family and all that.

813,아일랜드 라이프 리뷰,"TLDR: Is it worth $40 no, no at all, not even a little, however their is a argument to be made it is worth $20.
DLC is basically just a Hawaii skin on everything. You can own beach lots and build over the water (also has see through floors, kind of), ride jet ski's and a sailboats around on the lot. All the lots are connected like you can go to each without opening the manage worlds. Also can talk to Dolphins.

It adds Mermaids which are very underwhelming and kind of boring, they have a hydration mechanic (they will die if they don't swim for a period of time) instead of hygiene which basically means if you leave them to do their own thing, it will almost always be swimming, little annoying and they don't like being indoors.

The base outfit your sim wears is the swimsuit instead of the everyday one.

I would buy this if you really like bright colorful outfits that show a lot of skin.
Personally if you were to purchase this, think of it as a vacation DLC where you can use it for your sims to go on vacation for a few days to a week, it's not very good as a dedicated World even though that is what I use it for, you just a lot of variety when it comes to basically everything, you could add non-tropical stuff but it's going to look, weird out of place and crappy.

Not so TLDR lol:
The apparel and actual items are by far the best part of the DLC, I really like the tropical look/vibe, and it provides a reasonable amount of that. The outfits especially are very pretty, their are 18 different tops some of which are basically just slightly altered base game tops, but some are really good.
Their is a ton of skirt options (10), including Hula obviously. (Male and Female) Full body outfits are ok but never really wear any of them)
Their ""swimwear"" is basically bikini's with slightly more fabric on the bottom and top for casual wearing, you get like a coconut and shell top with a slightly different looking bottom for actual bikini's. (Although those are 2 of the best tops in the game)

That's pretty much it",Recommended
814,아일랜드 라이프 리뷰,This Sims 4 DLC is recommended for mermaid fans. You get to experience mermaid life if you buy Mermaidic Kelp that cost 500 rewards points in the rewards store. Save up rewards points if you want to turn your other sims into mermaids by Mermaidic Kelp.,Recommended
815,아일랜드 라이프 리뷰,It basically just adds Hawaii with Samoan Sims but not much in the way of content. It’s a pretty place to live so I guess it’s kind of worth it for that if you but it on sale and there’s a few little things you can do around the world within which I won’t spoil so I suppose I can recommend this one when it’s half price.,Recommended

I also like how it has its own culture and we can get to experience it, oh and there's also small festival but too bad, there's no notification so you have to remember the day that they are hosting the event. The Sulani townies are the best people in the Sims 4, they will come to your lot immediately if there's fire ad extinguish it, another thing is they also send text message and small social event when someone died in your household. The downsides are, mermaid and diving imo. Mermaid is the worst occult in the sims 4 as it doesn't have much ability compared to the others. Diving as well, we can't dive into the sea unlike previous game(although I did not play the previous game..)

It's yours my friend, as long as you have enough simoleans. The Conservationist career is pretty good, it's not great, but it's rewarding enough and has easy assignments. You can go scuba diving, build sand castles, ride on boats, but you can't go surfing (wtf?!). The Mermaid isn't the greatest occult type sim. They can swim faster, but they need to stay wet so they are showering, bathing, and swimming more often. Their abilities aren't too great either.

Mermaids I rate as a solid third for the life states. They're not as robust as vampires and magicians, but they are definitely better than the disappointment that was the feature poor aliens, servos, and ghosts.

For weighing up against the other expansions, I would rate this expansion high but not top.

'Island Living'


This DLC introduce the new Sulani islands, a tropical island paradise that introduce new weather (volcanic ereuptions), traits, mermaids, jobs, water scooters (which I think is one of the only vehicles in The Sims 4) and a remote island used for off the grid living which I quite like. I bought this DLC at around half price and I only bought it because of the location really and because i expected this dlc to include house boats like its predecessor , but The Sims 4 version does unfortunately not include that.

Mermaids are new though, you can swin extremely fast and dive for treasure or you can swin with dolphins and sing songs to strangers, you can become a mermaid by either eating mermadic kelp or design one yourself through Create a Sim
(I'm actually not sure if WooHoo'ing is possible as a mermaid, but if you know, let me know.)

Beside that the dlc comes with new jobs like lifeguard, fisherman and diver, I havent tried either of them but I heard they are all very basic and the dlc allows for building buildings in low water so you can build with full ocean view which is one of the reason I got the dlc.

It also comes with a single remote island that allows for off the grid living, so on this island you are all by yourself with no running water or electricity, its quite refreshing to play the game like this, its a new experience.

I loved how you can customize the animals more than you could in the Sims 3; however, I dislike how you don't have control over the animals.

912,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"Pros and Cons of the DLC

Pros

Cute animals
Nice to make your own pets in or cats from warrior cats like Mapleshade and Firestar
Nice to run a vet Clinic


Cons

When animals run away it is kinda of annoying because it doesn't give you a reason why the ran away. You go out and look for them and you cant post ads around your town to help locate them. Sure you can use a computer or your phone to put out an alert but its no the same their should also be option to add a reward if some finds your pet. For some reason your pet just comes back on their own every time which can happen in real life but no one even drops your pet off because the found them.

Over priced because The Sims was made free last year (I think) and the recently made a kit free for a limited time. If you want to get this wait till it is on sale or is made free permanently or temporally. Its also not worth the price so don't waste your money on it. Also if they make this DLC free permanently I wont buy anymore Sims DLCS or other content because they just keep making stuff free.

Adoption its nice to adopt animals but I personally think their should be an option to foster animals. Because not everyone wants to permanently adopt an animal so its nice to foster. Also I would be nice to run your own animal shelter but whatever.

The training is honestly useless because the aren't any dog shows or anything like competitions. All the training is useful for is to get your dog to go into a certain potion for a painting from interference or a simstgram photo. It kinda of disappointing that all you can really do is show off what you have taught your dog to other sims.

For some reason this DLC did not have horses like the sims 3 one did also that one is much cheaper.


Why aren't the pure-breeds because two purebred German shepherds together should be purebred German Shepard puppies right? But they are not.


There are big dogs and small dogs but no medium sized dogs.

Also why the heck are their no dogs houses for your dogs. Or even cattios/window boxes for your cats.

No bunnies either.

Also the ageing up system for the puppies and kittens doesn't work unless you give them an age up treat


You cant control them like a human sim which makes it not feel like a sims game :/ They are more like npcs then sims.


Why aren't there service or protection or guard dogs?



For some reason your pets forgot what you teach them not tricks but misbehaviour such as scratching furniture or attacking sim or even going outside to use the bathroom.",Not Recommended

925,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"Summary: no pet competitions, interactions with pets limited because you can't control then and they don't do much, vet clinic cool, you have to buy a separate lot from your house to open one and you can have employees.

I got it on sale. I absolutely never would pay full price for this.

I have to say, I was expecting a better DLC than the Sims 3 pets. Considering the price of this thing, and the years separating both games, I really don't think it was an unreasonable expectation. It is not even remotely as good as the Sims 3 pets which AT LEAST came with the horses.

You cannot control the pets, they are not sims. Which makes sense, I like that. But they do nothing. They just kinda chill around. You don't really have to correct them or condition behaviors. They don't destroy anything, they don't really have needs. When their little icon is green they are happy, when it's grey you ask them what's wrong. That's the whole interaction. You can train them but what's the point THERE ARE NO COMPETITIONS

This is unforgivable. No competition. They added a new skill, but it's utterly useless because the pets do nothing anyway and you can't monetize your training. Ridiculous. I'm not spending hours of training just to go show off my dog's skills to random sims.

That one is silly but there are no dog houses. Not a single one. There's one small bed and one big bed. That's the whole of the stuff for dogs. That game really makes me feel like it was made to leave us unsatisfied so we'd buy more sh*t. I'm kinda angry.

I bought it mostly for the vet clinic, of which I am generally happy. I love the concept of it, I was annoyed that I couldn't open a clinic on my house lot, but I made an apartment above my clinic, so I can live with it. The employee system sucks though, they are annoying and they get in the way, and you can't assign shifts. But that's just annoying, I still love having a clinic.",Not Recommended

Maybe things have changed now but I haven't play in a long time but otherwise I liked it. So I suppose I'm indifferent about it.,Recommended

cons:
1. it is the saddest thing when you see a stray cat or dog outside your house =(
2. you NEED a bath in your house if you have a dog because if they have the adventurous trait they go in mud daily",Recommended
933,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"I am in LOVE with this pack, although I feel there could of been so many more animals added to this pack! Recently the horse pack came out, and honestly it should have been apart of this pack. Along with reptiles, amphibians, and other animal that can be kept as a pet! Maybe even bigger cats and dogs, like tigers, wolves, panthers, etc.

For those looking for wild animals as pets, you can actually have a raccoon and a fox as a pet in this pack! You have to differentiate it with a dog or cat though, the fox is under dog, and the raccoon is under cat. Which, if they were planning to do this, they should've added so many more animals! If you actually want wilder animals, although, I recommend Cottage Living since you can actually have rabbits, cows, llamas, or whatever.

I do love the world that comes with this though, and the dogs and cats (and foxes and raccoons..) are very adorable! I recommend this pack to anyone that has a love for the animals and the family pets.",Recommended
934,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,SUPER CUTE I LOVE IT but i wish you could control the animals like you do the sims,Recommended
935,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"I absolutely Love the idea of Sims having pets...I have since I first started playing Sims Deluxe Edition on my Windows 98.... Other Sims games have given you the ability to control the pet (to be honest I can only say ""cat"" because I do not think I have ever owned a dog in any Sims game...) and this version does not. To be honest, that makes it more realistic to owning a pet, as you can't control their actions - only influence them. However as a real life pet (cat) owner I can't in good conscious play with the Sims pets when my own are awake and looking at me with judgement in their eyes.
A good Sims expansion, especially with the vet stuff, and I do like the items that it adds to your Build/Buy Modes. They are by far unique in the expansions as they have specific functions.
However, I can't stop my cats from wanting to have a litter box in EVERY ROOM - which is probably the most unrealistic cat thing ever as they are very attached to their poop-places.... anyway, they do always come back after running away so that makes up for it.",Recommended
936,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"This is just my opinion. I find that the gameplay is quite shallow, especially that the main feature in this dlc is CATS and DOGS but we have no control of it like Sims 2 and 3 (Sure I've never played both of it so maybe I could be wrong, but it surely is better). Other than cats and dogs and the vet, I honestly have no idea what to do, well yes the world Brindleton Bay is one of the best world in the game, the cas is solid, the bbs are nice too. But I think the gameplay is just 50/50, you either use it A LOT or never use it, quite hard for me to tell if recommend or no, I'm quite neutral at this pack.",Recommended

She woke back up but is tip toeing back home from across the world. WTF? Otherwise I'm happy to have my pets at a discount black friday sale price because the original price is ridiculous for how little you can do with the pets. Not many clothes options and no option to actually make them fluffy outside of just drawn lines all over the pet. My irl cats are really fluffy. Yes I messed around on the cat maker for a long time, but only 2 tail options, no ear fluff, no body fluff, kinda stupid. Not to mention you can't control the pets.

But you also can't open their panel or view their needs in any way. They are completely NPC.

They're constantly sick, or upset, or running away from home (even if they're happy for once). It's just not feasible to play this without having your own vet equipment on your lot.

You can put them in cute outfits, make them look like raccoons, and do some cute things like ""pamper on couch"", but in the end they're just really annoying NPC creatures that take up slots in your family home.
It would probably work better to make friends with strays and never actually have your own pet.

I like a lot of the decor and CAS items, and I like having a new skill (vet skill).
You can have a sim with cat ears, but it's a hairstyle not an accessory, so you also have to have this really ugly shaggy hair if you want cat ears.

There are all sorts of glitches and issues, especially regarding training and relationships with pets. But the training skill is short, boring, easy to master, and completely useless.",Not Recommended

995,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"This DLC has it's good points and it's bad points.

Good: Pets. It's always nice to have pets. The painting is also very helpful, namely the color wheel. There's a decent mix of breeds, including foxes. The foxes have four presets, the red fox, grey fox, arctic fox, and silver fox which is a variation of the red fox.

Bad: The presets in the breeds and coats are pretty bad on some of them. The Husky only has one coat preset compared to the Malamute's 3, and they could share the presets. The dingo looks starved, the mastiff looks wrong, the Boston Terrier's muzzle is too short. There's way too many mutts in the breeds presets. The Akita Inu and the Shiba Inu only have one coat preset, when there should be 3-4 for them, and they could share like the Husky and Malamute. The Akita Inu is conflated with the american akita, which are two different breeds. The poodle alone has 3 different breed presets, each with a different haircut, and the Pomeranian has a second one with a haircut as well. It can be hard to paint the animals since they move around so much, so it can a lot of skill and a delicate touch to get them just right, as in they move right as you're starting. There is also some missing colors for the pets. You can recolor the breeds, but there's no yellows or golds for your Sunshine or Honey Tabby, just a rather vivid orange preset. The pets get sick a lot, which can be concerning, and then you have to take them to the vets and hope you can afford treatment, or learn the veterinarian skill just to care for them.

I'm fairly neutral on this one, I only got it since it was half off during the spring sale.",Recommended

999,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"The DLC is very cool and very cute. Its awesome being able to have adorable pets to look after.However there is 1 bit problem in my opinion. The game needs a pet care option.Like, if you need a break from your pets, you can take them to a place where they will be cared for for a certain time and then you can go pick them up when the time is up, that way you can focus on stuff you wanna do with your sims, while also knowing your pets are being looked after. I love the DLC and I love having my adorable dogs, but with keeping up with the sims needs and then my pets need attention to be happy, then you basically have to get back to for-filling your sims needs again and then rinse and repeat and you never get time to do anything else. So I REALLY think the DLC would benefit from SOME SORT of pet care option, or like a Pet Nanny. All in all its a great DLC, to get adorable pets for your Sims, but it seriously needs some sort of Pet Care / Pet Nanny option.",Recommended

PROS-
-You get cute, furry little pets!
-More clothing options
-Amazing build options
-Advanced and special CAS options for pets(For example: you can make the animals have different eye colors on each eye, there are tons of breeds, you can paint them different colors, you can free draw on them, like if a dog has a mark on its back, you can draw it)
-Cute hairs and acessories!

CONS-
-You cannot control the animals, you cannot click on them at the bottom of your screen like you can with other Sims.
-Animals can run away(its very sad for me)
-They take up one place in your household
-They can bark or meow a crap ton, it kinda gets annoying
-The game pass is pretty over priced

The best thing about this pack is that you don't have to have them, which is sad.
Animals are great if you enjoy doing menial chores. You'd need to train them as well, if you can squeeze in any time between them needing grooming, pooping and the vet visit.
Having an animal should low-key be a paid job; because good luck to you with working on top of that.
The animals are annoying and repetitive. First of all, they take a spot in the family; meaning that for each animal that you have, you have a spot less for playable Sims. You can’t even select and control an animal properly without installing mods.
They are just plain boring. The only bearable life with them is if you lock the motive decay and just live a semi-normal life.

Your dogs, cats, whatever things with four legs will literally stretch out like a monster in a horror movie, and your pets are designed to be very needy and stupid, they just don't let your sim do something. Dogs cannot poop or pee inside the house and these stupid things cannot go up and down the stairs, which means if your front door is behind the stairs, you have to take your dogs out manually every time they need to take a ♥♥♥♥. And they get sick randomly, which is fine provided that the vet system is well functioning but it is not. You cannot even click a menu on the stupid check-in machine at the default vet. You have to examine your cat and dog by yourself after putting a hideous vet table in your place. Well, my love for animals was not enough to put up with all these ♥♥♥♥♥, so I don't keep any pet in my active households anymore.

In Sims 4, the pets just stand around in the same spot endlessly making meowing or barking noises and aren't really much more interactive than a sofa (and they're much less useful than the sofas). I made two kittens expecting lots of cuteness and they do not interact with each other at all, ever. Worse, they are constantly broken within the game, unable to see litterboxes or food bowls that are right in front of them, and unable to get from one room to the next without being picked up and moved. I've literally moved houses 3 times just to try to fix the kittens and all their broken pathways. I made a dog one time and entered create a sim to delete it after a couple Sim days because, once again, it stood around doing nothing and then barked endlessly to be walked. I wouldn't have minded the walking part, but every time I took the dog on a walk, it was 12+ sim hours and I had to call my Sim back home without actually finishing the walk. Sims 3 makes Sims 4 look like an absolute joke. Sims 4 doesn't even measure up to Sims 1 in a lot of areas. It's really sad what's been done with these games.",Not Recommended

1068,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"For context, I really enjoy The Sims 4, despite mostly playing and being a huge fan of The Sims 3. I recognize it has its faults, but I often find genuine depth in it that I enjoy. Every pack I own was bought on sale save for My Wedding Stories, and the kits. Most steam reviews for this game and its content are just petty complaints or jokes, so I've set out to present sincere reviews that accurately describe and assess its content.

Solid chance that if you bought The Sims 4, it came bundled with Cats and Dogs. It's a hallmark DLC that has been in every Sims game since at least The Sims 2. One would think that after so long we might end up with this type of content included in the base game, but no such luck with a company owned by EA. You take your overpriced DLC and you like it, or say goodbye to some of your fondest gaming memories. Such is life in the capitalist world we live in. But on the off chance you only bought the base game, I'm here to help you along the way.

Cats and Dogs is a *very* straightforward pack. It adds cats and dogs to the game, along with associated items and even a handful of CAS choices. Granted, none that won't paint you as one of those kinda creepy old people that seem to have nothing to their personality other than their pets. But I suppose there's a little bit of that in all of us.

Here's the nitty gritty. Is it an accurate and effective simulation for owning pets? Absolutely, I know it drives me up a wall when my dog just won't stop trying to eat the plain and unseasoned spoiled rice I threw away in the trash despite her full food bowl and the abundance of home made treats I feed to her on a regular basis, so why shouldn't it surprise me when a video game dog gladly rolls around in the disgusting refuse of my sim household? Its realistic, and I often play my games in such a way that I approach things realistically and appreciate the things that don't ruin my immersion. However there's a few small issues with that. Mostly, realism is occasionally cast aside for a more fun take. For instance, in a typical RPG (The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, VTM-Bloodlines, Darkest Dungeon, etc), it is very rare that you must deal with issues like sleep, hunger, or hard limitations. Bloodlines could REQUIRE that you stop whatever you're doing to rush to your haven so you don't instantly die the moment the sun rises. And while that would be accurate and realistic, it is not very fun. Similarly, while it does make sense for your pets to be autonomous and out of your direct control, is that really fun? Depends on your perspective. In this case, I'm inclined to say it is not, and only provides meaningless work for the player, but I recognize that may not be the case for others. Additionally, your pets offer very little in the way of gameplay advantages. They mostly are just whiny noise machines that occasionally run away for no reason, wake up your sims, roll around in trash at every available opportunity, and loudly remind you of their presence whenever you may tolerate it least.

I am an animal lover. I have a few cats and a dog I love very deeply. But pets in the sims 4 offer almost nothing to the experience, and are mostly a pit for resources and management that never returns the favor.

Pros:

- Own pets or dogs. Cool.

- Highly customizeable pets.

- Other packs easily blend in with this one, such as Cottage Living. Want a fox for a pet? Those two combined mean you can! Foxes are my favorite animals, so that especially was a treat.

- Small handful of CAS items. Some fun, most fitting a very particular trope. Like, crazy cat lady.

- Pets DO offer your sim occasional satisfaction points. How often do you get them? Not a clue! But sometimes you have an option for ""feel the love"" which provides a WHOPPING 100 satisfaction points! Unimpressive, to say the least.

- There are a plethora of interactions, plus traits and aspirations associated with pets. At best it is charming, at worst, it feels like filler.

Cons:

- pets are entirely autonomous. You have absolutely no control over them outside of your sim's interactions with them.

-owning pets is rarely rewarding and mostly provides challenge

- pets are often loud and DEEPLY obnoxious. all of them suffer the same issues, and require mostly the same training. this is an area where the game departs from some level of realism, as pets are very much like people in that they do not all have the same shortcomings, and may struggle in some areas more than others.

- pets seem to run away for no reason in particular, regardless of the comfort of their surroundings or how well they're taken care of.

- pets are CONSTANTLY dirty, and afaik can ONLY be bathed in a bathtub. So unless you have one of those, your pet will forever be disgusting and smelly.

Do I recommend Cats and Dogs? Absolutely not. It is an abysmally conceived pack that never at any point thinks to respect the player. But clearly I'm biased. If all of this sounds decent to you, by all means buy it. But I cannot recommend it to most others in good faith. As usual, only buy on sale, because this content is just not worth whatever they're asking for it.",Not Recommended

1072,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"definitively not worth it's regular price. but it goes on sale quite often and that makes it okay.

I add a pet to each of my households and then end up getting rid of them in CAS. They're fun for a while until you have a full house and it's always upset about something, and whining, and barking, and being scared of the TV with no way of fixing it, and needing to play and go on walks all the time... you get the gist.
Toddlers only have like three interactions with the dogs (and probably cats too) which is kind of disappointing, but they are cute when they do it.
The build mode items and clothes are really nice I have to admit, and after transferring from PlayStation to PC I just needed the items. (and hair!). Brindleton Bay is a very good spot with cute houses and lots, I also missed that a bunch.
I have never touched the vet career before so take this with a pinch of salt.

It is truly fun with good CAS + build mods items and a cool new location making it a good starter pack. Made even better when the deluxe edition + cats and dogs is on sale. (most of the time it is priced the same, if not cheaper than the regular game by itself.)",Recommended

I also like the vet profession.",Recommended
1077,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"I like the sims, I like having pets. I understand that in real life you can't control the animals, but this is a game. The animals in this version are boring and just something to watch. The items for them are lackluster and just as boring as the pets. Nothing about this was good. I didn't have fun with the vet either, it was just another pain.",Not Recommended

1079,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"Absolutely love the world from this pack. Especially with Reshade. CAS and BB items are great as well. But the main draw of this pack is cats and dogs, and.. I just don't know on them. They're fun, but also so frustrating because I don't know what's going on with them half the time because you can't see their moodlets or anything. I haven't tried it out yet, but I think the playable pets mod might help. The other big issue with them is they take up an entire slot in a household. That's right, with two pets, you can only have 6 sims. Of course mods fix this but still. It's annoying that with three pets, I can't have more than 5 sims unless I mod the game which mind you, you can't do on console. If you see yourself using pets all the time and play this on PC (which, you're on steam, I hope you are playing it here) then get it, otherwise, skip. If you like pretty worlds Sulani is better in that case. CAS there too. But pets can be fun, so if that's enough for you..",Recommended

1081,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,The Sims series is an amazing game series that has a very talented/passionate development team. My review is not aimed towards them but their publisher which is well known for figuring out very creative ways to monetize every single aspect of their products where such beauty becomes so soulless. It does not help they obviously are at the developers throats to pump out as much content as they possibly can to fill up Their wallet.,Not Recommended

I have 2 complaints. 1: The price, get it while its on sale, $40 is pretty high for DLC in general.

2: The vet career is kind of annoying, I have about 10 High-End Robot Vacuums and the floor still looks like a pigsty. I don't really have a solution for this problem though, your sims can just be unhappy and you'll have to accept it.",Recommended

1089,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"I enjoy this DLC as my first for the Sims 4, but I will list some pros and cons if you are on the fence about it.

Pros:
Huge variety of cat and dog breeds
Easy to customize and make look exactly like your IRL pet
Pack comes with a lot of cute furniture I use in all my houses
Your sim can buy and run a vet clinic
There's the Veterinary skill. Where you can learn to treat illnesses in pets
You can send your pets off to find collectibles with Training skill
You can adopt any stray cat or dog wandering around
Ability to breed or spay/neuter your pet
Pets can give your sims lots of emotions and a great way to socialize.
Garden plants specifically for cats emotions and cooking recipes for homemade dog food
Toddlers and older can interact with the pets, which is cute.
They are super cute and really add to the feel of the game in my opinion



Cons:
No horses (as was in the Pets version of Sims 2 and 3)
You cannot control your pets, meaning you also have to kinda guess what their mood is
They can get scared of random objects in your house, and no way to train them out of it (computer, fridge, coffee maker)
Sometimes they just run away. I haven't figured out exactly why yet. Your sim will get the ""Sad"" emotion
Training skill had potential but pretty much ""Lecture cat to keep off counters"" or you are telling your dog to roll over for an hour before he finally does it.
Dogs bark... a LOT. Even without the noisy trait. Seems excessive imo


If it is on sale, I would say buy it!",Recommended
1090,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"I got this bundle when there was a good offer on both the game and the DLCs (I think it was Black Friday). They cat animations are adorable, the whole thing is...
Pets add a lot more fun with the game, especially when you have more than three in one household, and is much sadder when they pass away.
Overall this is great, but definitely get this when it's in a big sale.",Recommended

1092,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"Like most Sims 4 packs you should only buy this on sale.

It's not the SIms 3 pets.....but it still adds so much life into your game. The world is beautiful, I use it pretty often because of the beaches and many empty lots for building. I also enjoy the additional game play that comes with the interactive vet career! It's so reminiscent of the Sims 3 Island Paradise hotel feature. It does have it's down sides and does not live up to it's predecessor but for what it is, it isn't completely terrible.",Recommended

1097,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"Not worth it. I have this DLC and never saw any animal outside of made. I never made them and there is not single sims person owning them and bringing them along to parks etc. Outside of main expansion area. When sims 3 from get go showed players other sims had animals. Like i was on supriced that first day in sims 3 wild horse ran around my home. But in sims 4 you never see hints of animal activity entire world.

Like if i saw my neighbor walking their pets outside of walkways etc. It would increase worth of this dlc. But again. All DLC with some elements are locked in certain area of world map. Making empty shell of game even meaningless. Like in vampire dlc there are vampire characters and caster dlc casters. But how game dlc does not support game. Like you notice vampire running and single vampire attempt to drink your blood as tutorial. Their interaction ends there. In this there is none like apocalypse happened all animals are single area of world so they wont die.

Do not get this outside of making own pets. Sure this dlc stacks with some other. But again.... All dlc in this game is really shallow and meaningless.",Not Recommended

as for a genuine review; i love the build mode items. they're fabulous. as for cas items.... eh. theres better, but theres also certainly worse. gameplay is boring after an hour or so. pets aren't engaging enough and you can pretty much fill their food up and forget about them. only reason i bought was for build mode items and im still pretty disappointed. save your money until its on sale, and if you genuinely *need* to get dlc get seasons.",Not Recommended

The amount of customizing you can do to your pets is actually really good. The world it comes with is really pretty and it has a decent amount of lots. The vet clinic gets very boring after a while.

I got maybe, like, 3 hours of enjoyable-ish gameplay out of this? Which is nothing compared to the minimum 100 hours from Sims 3.

I could've gotten one or two full on games, that would've entertained me more, for the same price.

Dogs don't protect your house, or chickens in Cottage Living, all they do is run around the house, piss, and howl at your sim for, often, no apparent reason. Cats do nothing but eat, sleep, crap, and meow constantly, often to sheer annoyance. They're a bit too much like real pets, except I'd rather be scooping cat ♥♥♥♥ than listening to the damn howling and meowing from the pets in this pack.

-Get mod to make pets playable if you miss the sims 3
-Get mod to slow down needs decay (if you have the same play style as me)
-get mod to get pet jobs if you want that sims 2 feel
-get cc for more collars, clothes, eyes because the things that comes with this DLC is so vacant

Other cons:
-ah yes, hamsters are a separate DLC
-oh yes, no parrots
-no horses?? why??? missed opportunity big time, I would of loved simplified horses remade in sims 4 that are more managable than it was in sims 3 when you owned every pet possible
-they get sick too often
-less character and soul than in sims 2 and 3
-the dogs are such a downgrade compared to the dogs in sims 3 WHYYY
-dog constantly needs to be bathed
-no character to add where the dog loves to swim like in sims 3

I don't think it's anyone's primary reason for getting this expansion, however the Veterinary Clinics that you can run are imo the best business that your Sims can own.

I love cats and dogs so this is obviously a must have dlc for me or anyone else who loves them.
It adds cats and dogs only, leaving other pets like hamsters or rats for another dlc. But what did you expect from EA?

Anyhow I love this dlc. I may be in minority here but I actually love that I can't control my pets and they are independent. And I love the fact that it's not obvious what a cat or dog wants at the time. I see this as a more realistic depiction of pets. You need to pay attention and spend time with them.

Creating your pet is a cool feature which lets you create new kind of dog or cat. You can make a whole new breed with these tools. You can alien-like dog or ugly cat, it's up to you.
It also adds a vet career where you take care of pets in your pet clinic. It works similarly to restaurant career/business where you actually get to do your job. So if pets you have at home are not enough for you and you want be overwhelmed by cats and dogs then taking care of them in a vet clinic will be what you want. Again a really nice feature.

There's also a new map Brindleton Bay which is beautiful. This location really is one of the best. You have a harbor, lighthouse, park. Maybe it doesn't sound like a lot but the map is very detailed and feels lively. And is full of cats and dogs of course since all locations are pet friendly. I'm only disappointed that you can't do much at the lighthouse except for woohoo.
You can play with your pets in the park, fetch the ball, leash, go jogging with your dog and some other activities.
Like always you get a bunch of related items. Food bowls, litter boxes, pet care items, treats. The most interesting one is robot vacuum cleaner. It keeps your house clean and cats happy.
You get some new traits like cat lover or dog lover and new aspiration related to animals.

This is a good dlc for those who can't live without cats and dogs. It's a must have for these people. It adds a beautiful detailed map and lots of pet related stuff so you will be occupied for quite a while.",Recommended
1189,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"it's awesome the pack!
You get to pick cats, dogs, and raccoons i think too (i just purchased it). you can use genetics on them, and stray paint patterns or whatever you want on your pets. they have lots of things to do with them, it i think its great over all.
I have 2 cons: a few more varieties for eyes and possibly something more to the pack that's enjoyable. In my opinion, the eyes look a bit funky and not what I'm going for, and i would also like to add onto this (even though its not related) to see what they need. Continuing my other con, maybe more actions, or more things for the pets themselves? maybe toys, or maybe some other beds?

This was fixed for a short time if I exited and re-entered the game but would start again within one in-game day. I haven't yet checked to see if this issue persists with a cat but I will update this review if they don't have similar issues (which I am currently assuming they do).

I requested a refund for this DLC which I have never done before with a game on here (and I have way too many) but my request was rejected due to too much playtime.

This is the second best expansion i have brought for TS4, it's a massive stepup from TS2 cats and dogs, though there is no horses which was added in TS3 (no one really cares about horses).

There are heaps more dog and cat breads in the sims 4 and you can not adopt puppies and help them grow into dogs, each animal has there own traits which is also an amazing step up from sims 2, unsure if pets can get jobs as yet, though only issue i have encounted and it's my own silly mistake is forgetting too unleash your animal once you take them for a walk as you have too unleash.

You can also train your pets too do certain behavours like not playing in trash, laying down on bed etc etc which is also fun and amazing really recommend this expansion if looking for some animals in the game.

There is also a new world and a bunch of new items and clothing even Oldschool Doc Martins have been added which i was not expecting too see Skinhead boots in the game so thank you EA.",Recommended
1212,Cats__Dogs 리뷰,"It's broken beyond repair.


Expansion Includes:

The Sims 4 Cats & Dogs, not to be confused with The Sims 3 Pets, is a unique expansion pack as it solely offers cats and dogs. In comparison, The Sims 3 expansion included horses and critters. Despite this, I think it's not necessarily a bad thing because this expansion pack allows for more opportunities with cats and dogs. You can adopt them not only from the phone, but also from the street. Additionally, the pack offers a veterinarian business career, which enables players to start their own vet clinic. However, I have not tried this feature, so I can't say whether it's enjoyable or not.

Bugs:

It's so incredibly buggy, broken beyond repair. In contrast to The Sims 3, The Sims 4 adopted pets have so many issues. For instance, the first cat I adopted refused to get inside my house, and whenever I tried to pick it up, it would run outside and sit in the rain until the vet took it away. On my second try, I bought an apartment, but the cat got stuck on everything and refused to eat. Consequently, the vet took it away again.

Another issue I found annoying is that simmers cannot take care of the pets by themselves. This is very frustrating because the pets get taken away quickly. In The Sims 3, you could leave your household on standby, and they would do pretty well without you. In contrast, in The Sims 4, they seem to depend on you to survive.

Regrettably, I cannot recommend this expansion pack as it's the most broken in the game, and it's been three years since it was released, so don't count on it being fixed.",Not Recommended
1213,심즈의 사랑법 리뷰,"For me, this has really become unenjoyable. From meeting someone to climbing in the sack in a couple minutes. You can set your romantic preferences, but the Sims ignore them.

So please, take reports of anything too extreme with a grain of salt.

There are so many excellent items, in both build mode and create-a-sim. Lots of mid-century things that I like to see, and things not common to previous packs.

There are several items that reminded me of some of the original Sims items that I loved so much, and I'm glad to see things that spark the same kind of joy in me.

Better control over relationships and the new date planning are huge improvements, and they give you a lot more ability to play characters the way you want. The new city is charming and fun.

If you're curious about what this DLC has to offer you buckle up because here we go.
It is my personal view that this pack is one of the better options that EA offers. This is based upon the very lovely customise options not only for sim creation but also the building aspect. It offers players more ways to express creativity in their world.

- As mentioned above building finally got some much needed love, New wallpapers and furniture to add an unique burst of personalization to your adoring sims homes.

- The clothes that are offered give off a starburst of vibrancy not only because of the flashy shades used but also the fashionable styles, Of course you also receive some new quirky outfits like the catfish suit for the silly sims.

- The new romance system added with this DLC gives off a more realistic relationship dynamic, you can personally set what your sims find attractive in a potential partner/ find attractive in your partner through the options, an example would be Hair colour preference. To take a side step from that you can also ask your partner to attend a romance consultant through one of the many new interactions. You can keep track of the relationship through romance satisfaction.

- There are new traits, New aspirations, a new lot trait, new television stations and a new romance skill for you to work on / discover.

- With the added NPC comes a new small fishing mission for your sims to complete, You will be given the opportunity to not only help the NPC but also learn about the new character's personality and connect through the short story attached.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's what I personally see as a negative side to the DLC, I personally experienced a few of the common bugs, one example is when you use the 'Cupids corner' sims dating app on your sims phone to set up a date, the date proceeds to automatically end in a failure without experiencing the date at all. EA are rolling patch after patch to tackle each reported problem one by one so it's not something to be fully worried about. I personally feel the new map area is lacking in terms of room, in other DLC content we saw apartment buildings with neighbours in the same building being used but in Lovestruck you only have the option to build without them and I feel that's a wasted opportunity. You are only permitted to build 5 lots in the new map which adds to my personal disappointment. I would always recommend you wait to purchase during a sale as the price again is not really too affordable.",Recommended

1248,심즈의 사랑법 리뷰,"While this expansion is nice, it should have been sold as a game pack. Lovestruck adds very little gameplay addition to the sims and adds some build mode objects and a new map. Thats great but it doesnt change that MUCH about the sims. If anything, this just expands on the dating aspect on the game. Thats really it.

Pros: other sims can now propose to your sims. There is a lot more free love happening throughout the map. This definitely makes this more interesting in terms of relationships and gives more reason to keep a relationship alive as it will dwindle down without more effort put in.

Cons: The price point is the biggest con. There is no reason imo to have charged 40 dollars for such a minimal change to the game. It should have been priced at something more like laundry stuff pack where it did add the elements of laundry and changed little gameplay. I guess because they added a map they chose to charge more. All of what makes up the lovestruck expansion could have been a free update. It feels like basics that should have always been present in game and honestly is a slight rip off of many mod makers who already found a way to implement a lot of this in game.",Not Recommended
1249,심즈의 사랑법 리뷰,"As usual, EA releases a half-hearted expansion pack.

CAS mode is probably the only good aspect of this pack with a lot of ""date night"" vibes, and men do get some masculine items (finally)! Eyelashes do look a bit janky though, but makeup got a big boost.

The build mode items is underwhelming, there is a modern / art deco vibe to some of the furnature, but most of it is not inclined towards regular house items. If anything, most of the build items in this pack look like venue decoration items.

The gameplay is extremely half-assed (excuse my language), cupid's corner is buggy but works. Dates have a lot more depth, but is reminiscent of My Wedding Stories. Spoiler alert: most of the interactions are quite buggy. It also seems like EA relies too much on rabbit holes. Could it be too much to ask for a hotel / new interactive job? For the price of 40 dollars, not at all! Turn On and Offs are silly, instead of clothes preference I would like to have seen more realistic options. Relationship dynamics are the same as family dynamics.

The world is very low-effort. It is visibly obvious that no effort was put in both in-lot and background buildings. Doors are missing in the base lots, and most of the world is not available to build on. Unlike worlds such as Oasis Springs, the background houses are complete rectangles. For 40 dollars, this should not be the case.

Overall: Just get this on sale. There is really nothing anyone is missing out on for the next couple of months. If one really wants to see a boost in masculine items, just get CC.",Not Recommended

First, the new world Ciudad Enamorada is gorgeous, but sadly it only has 13 lots with no apartments, but at least we have 2 penthouses! It's still a lovely world to play in, it has many nice places to take photo with, just like Tartosa. Cas is looking dope, but about 30% of the Cas items are more to WooHoo(iykyk) and costumes, so it's not usable outside of those activities, but generally it has very nice clothes, hairs, accessories, and of course no new cas for kids and toddlers since this is for adult sims. Build mode is quite a disappointment as it's quite small compared with other expansion packs of which you can't really build a house with only this pack, like there's no new bathtub(missed opportunity to add heart bathtub) and kitchen set, it does have nice bbs too, especially wallpapers, windows, bar and gym items, most clutters are cute. However there's only like 3 build items with new unique gameplay, this is a small flop. Gameplay is what makes this pack good, it looks very small and niche compared with other packs like Cottage Living or Seasons, cause this pack focused at making the pre-existed feature more in-depth and a lot more fun and options to play with, similar matters with Growing Together, there's new phone call with events, romantic interactions, new career is also quite fun too, AND AXOLOTLS!!!!!!! Love the fact that we can't sell it and only can release it back, which is nice small details. All in all, is this worth it? If I want to be honest here, most Sims 4 packs are expensive especially they even raised the price in some countries (Canada, Australia, etc), I still hate how they do Pre-order limited bonus items.. if you don't mind those bonus items, always wait for sale!!! But this pack really makes the game interesting and fun to play, hope whoever bought it will enjoy it!",Recommended
1251,심즈의 사랑법 리뷰,"TLDR; Even a hater of the recent Sims DLCs has to rate this a 9.2/10. Easily the best expansion in years.

I want to preface this by saying I am completely biased as a reviewer; I HATE EA SOOOO MUCH. Seriously. I think they’re money grabbing cash-cows and don’t even get me started on the dlc of dlc that is mfps. Whatever.

That said… when I say this is the best expansion pack they’ve done in a while—I really mean it.

For whatever your primary reason for buying the packs, new game content, new worlds, new CAS items, more build items… This expansion pack is AMAZING. First in a long time that’s actually felt like a proper expansion pack. It feels like there’s hella (actually good) content to go through, and in an amazing world with more than three lots, no less.

As much as I’m pained to admit it, EA cooked with this one. The furniture items? Slayed. The CAS items? Slayed. The gameplay? Yeah, slayed. That, and it seems like the art team abandoned the dreary grey-ish color palette of the build-buy/CAS items that’s been plaguing at least half their swatches since laundry stuff, WE FINALLY GET SATURATION BACK!

Feels like original sims whimsy has returned, with what feels like a way to ‘personalize’ relationships with new dynamics—a real quality of life feature. And, of course, I LOVE the knockoff Tinder lol.

If you’re on the fence because the past few packs have been disappointing—have hope! This one’s cool as heck! Absolutely worth the buy.",Recommended
1252,심즈의 사랑법 리뷰,"This is my first time reviewing a Sims pack and this actually the first pack I bought at launch (or at least a day or two after launch) so I wanna share my unfiltered thoughts to you as a very lukewarm player who loves a good gameplay.

I won't be getting into Build/Buy because I'm not a good judge on the quality of BB items cuz to me, house go build build.

Let me first get into the cons.

First things first (I'm the realest), I wish there was more to the dating app.
More customization and interactions would be a life saver cuz I would like the app to act more like Social Bunny where you can send each other texts that are personalized to this pack which would be SOOO FUN!

Second con would definitely be the world. I wish there was more lots. Fr would love more residential lots.
The world seems so big and yet it's kinda like Get Famous where it has 3 entry-level lots and 3 high end ones/penthouses.

Third con; Motels are just rabbitholes which makes me UPSETT! It would be so fun if they were a completely new lot type! Motels and Hotels! It would've made this pack even MORE of a raunchy pack! Like if they actually did this, TRUST THAT I AM MAKING A SOGO HOTEL! XDDDD

There's also a temporary con and it's that in true sims fashion, it's pretty glitchy.
There's some bugs here and there and although they aren't game breaking right now and I haven't found any that ARE game breaking, it's still kinda crazy that the EA would let this slide at all.
Certain animations glitches, hiccups and unexpected resetting of models are pretty irritating and does mess with the immersion so I do hope they work those out.

With all of that out of the way, I LIKE THIS PACK!
Surprisingly LOVESTRUCK by it(no pun intended), actually!
It's fun in my subjective opinion.

The way it does dating in the game is so refreshing and does add a lot to the experience.
Dates add more necessary challenge to what would otherwise just be a clicking game and I really appreciate that!
The new mechanics for dating is so fun to do and it feels like you're actually trying to fulfill what your sim wants to do instead of doing a list of what a textbook definition of a date is.

I also love the implementation of boundaries and attraction!
Granted, it's a little messy in terms of UI but when it comes to function, I LOVE WHAT IT ADDS!
Again, it makes the romance system in game which was felt very flat line in recent gameplays more complex and interesting not to mention the dynamics you can have with the sims.

I love the added interactions to the game too! Especially the new animations! I found them really cute and adorable and it just makes me squeal not only a storyteller kind of player but also as someone who loves romance and playing with romance! And again, the dynamics you can get for your partners are really great and I love it!

The sexy costumes are also so fun to wear! Granted I do get frustrated because my sims wear the goofiest costumes but that's why it's fun and I'm just someone who likes hella raunchy stuff so I like it!

Overall, great pack!
Worth the price? Debatable.
I wouldn't suggest getting it this early because I do think the Sims Team needs to iron the glitches out and personally, I wouldn't say it's a complete must have.
I highly suggest getting it if you can and even more if it's on a sale. I don't really think any Sims pack is worth that full price in my honest opinion.
But if you are getting it, I will say that it is very fun and if you are someone who tends to do a lot of storytelling, this is great!

Overall, in terms of first impressions and gameplay, it's good!
It's just overtly pricey and I really suggest waiting for a price drop or sale.",Recommended

1255,심즈의 사랑법 리뷰,"ANNND yet again another pack that breaks your game, was it surprising? no. are we disappointed? yes.

trying to travel to a venue or anything else such as a bar, karaoke, gym so on will leave you with an error code pop-up and an orange exclamation mark over the venues in map overview. this isn't all, if you travel there with your sim and you get the error code to relaunch your game, your sim is stuck on the venue and you'll continuously be getting the same error code pop-up everytime you try to load your save.
essentially this means i'll probably have to wait a few weeks till they fix the game breaking bug, but then still the game will continuously, and always will be, broken and ""half-working"".
(keep in mind as well; i use no cc or mods whatsoever, this problem is caused with your complete base game + DLCs)

so as of now i suggest you wait 2-3 weeks before buying this (if you reeaally want it). currently this dlc only causes bugs and glitches that make your saves unplayable.",Not Recommended

1275,Get_To_Work 리뷰,"The Sims 4: Get to Work DLC is, in a word, a mixed bag. While it introduces some exciting features and a bit of fresh air into the workplace dynamics of The Sims 4, it often feels like a bit of a grind that echoes the monotony of actual work rather than providing a fun escape. The core of the expansion revolves around three active careers—Doctor, Scientist, and Detective—which offer a more hands-on experience compared to the usual rabbit-hole jobs, but the novelty wears off faster than you'd expect.

Let's break it down. The Detective career might be the most intriguing, as it lets you actively solve cases, arrest suspects, and even interrogate them in a cheesy, Law and Order-style fashion. However, the lack of narrative depth and repetitive tasks turn what could be a thrilling role into a somewhat tedious routine. The Scientist career brings a lot of quirky inventions and sci-fi elements into the game, but it too suffers from the repetition blues. The Doctor career, while realistic and progressive, also quickly becomes more about the grind than the excitement of saving lives.

The retail aspect is where things really start to stumble. Opening and running your own shop sounds like a blast on paper, but in practice, it’s a far cry from what fans of The Sims 2: Open for Business might remember. The system is stripped down, and customers just feel like mindless bots wandering your store until they eventually decide to buy something—or don’t. Employees are even worse, often more of a hindrance than a help, which can be incredibly frustrating.

The DLC isn’t without its charms, though. There’s a genuine thrill in the first few hours of trying out these careers, and the new objects and interactions bring a level of immersion that the base game sometimes lacks. But the fun is fleeting. After a while, the experience starts to feel like, well, a job—one that might not be worth the $40 price tag unless you’re a die-hard Sims fan who needs to collect every expansion.

So, if you're looking for a reason to keep playing The Sims 4, this expansion might not be the best motivation. Perhaps it’s time to take the hint and actually , because after a few hours with this DLC, you might find yourself itching to do something more productive—or just play a different game.",Not Recommended
1276,Get_To_Work 리뷰,"I wish it was in the base game. But that is fine, I guess. Though, some of the job tasks are difficult to accomplish because NPCs are useless or glitched (?) to do what they are supposed to do for the players to complete the tasks.",Recommended

People love to complain about it crashing or sims not doing what they're supposed to but I never really have any issue with that in sims ever. They never get stuck or anything. Sometimes an option I just clicked will go away and I'll have to click again but I'm used to that, it happens sometimes and doesn't really bother me.

What pains me the most is that I paid for Sims 4 right before it became free-to-play, and now I've kind of looped myself into paying for DLCs that aren't really adding much gameplay value. I can rationalize it on sale, but at full price no way.",Not Recommended
1292,Get_To_Work 리뷰,"Not worth $40. There are only three live careers and the ability too own a shop. If every full time job was a live job then it would be a $40 DLC. It's a $20 DLC, thankfully EA does plenty of sales.",Not Recommended
1293,Get_To_Work 리뷰,"Do yourself a favor and if you decide to buy it, make sure it's at least 50% off because really, it's not worth even that. I was well aware that I should never have my hopes high for a Sims 4 DLC so I can't say I'm really disappointed. I'll try to be short and simple.

- New skills are good but the notification when you level up in photography is bugged and basically you'll never see it, you have to check on your sim's skill list to find out.
- 3 new jobs where you can follow your sim and do stuff, to be honest they are more fun that I was expecting. Sadly these lots cannot be visited when you are not working (one exception in the next line).
- Your sim can give birth at the hospital venue, kinda adds a little to the experience, but is a very short plus.
- I was looking forward to see the new world added but it has very few lots, all of them are retail lots and you can only buy one. I never did and rarely visit the world itself. Totally not worth it.
- CAS/Build mode items are OK-ish
- I hate alien sims and this pack seem to have added a lot of them.

In general, the jobs are the highlight for me. It's not a good pack but given EA habit of releasing bug-packs disguised as DLCs I think it is not that bad. To the very end of writing this review I wasn't sure if recommend it since I actually like the jobs but now that I remember the aliens I have to say no.",Not Recommended

They don't even have an animation for when you spawn a new occult sim in CAS, like with the bats for Vampires and red energy for werewolves. It might seem small but the small touches are always what I love about this game. But this...It was just not fun at all.

Also the gameplay is just so broken.",Not Recommended
1306,Get_To_Work 리뷰,"I gotta say that I'm absolutely obsessed with this DLC.
.
First off, you can own your own retail stores, but ""retail"" just means that you can set almost any object for sale. This means you can sell things your sim created, like books, food, etc. I personally made a cute little bakery which works very nicely with the chef aspiration. The only problem is that you can't assign yourself a uniform so you either have to create an everyday outfit that matches the uniform or work in your street clothes. (If anyone knows something that fixes this please lmk in comments.)
.
Second of all, the careers. The doctor is a little boring from what little I've dabbled in and the detective can be fun, but the scientist career is absolutely hilarious. The wacky inventions like the serums and gadgets are incredibly entertaining, especially the Simray. Not only does it terrorize other sims in a funny way, but the mad scientist cackle is contagious and I always find myself laughing with my sim whenever he uses it.
.
Lastly, aliens! It's always a funny surprise whenever I discover that a townie is an alien, as most of them wear human disguises when they walk around (some of them just openly walk around in their true form). I didn't even know that my retail employee was an alien until he came into the science lab.
Playing as an alien is also really funny, as they have their own unique interactions that change depending on whether a sim knows you're an alien or not or if they are also an alien. They have options such as ""talk about human food"" with human sims or ""secret handshake"" with other alien sims.
Your sim can also get abducted by aliens and though it hasn't happened to me personally, apparently they can get pregnant during the abduction. Abductions can be prevented using the satellite that you can invent as a scientist.

You can allow your sim to become a mad scientist, invent cool stuff like the simray, that allows your sim to freeze other sims,
mind control other sims, and more! You can also chat to robot, and create a portal to a alien planet witch is kewl.
The detective career:
...........
Is my personal fav' get to work career, when your sim is first on the job their will be randomized criminals so your can take mugshots of them and other stuff. (if you don't put the criminal back in their jail cell they WILL try to escape)
You get to go to cool crime scenes and gather evidence, once your sim has enough evidence, You go out and for a person
to arrest.

The retail career:
............
With the get to work pack, you can now have your sims own retail stores! You can sell a-buncha stuff, like books your sim created, plants, paintings, food, clothing... basically anything!

And there's cute li'l aliens! and uhhhh and some cool new CAS clothing and makeup, and build mode items, yeah.
In my opinion It is worth the money! Oh also I forget your sims can be abducted now and if their ""Male"" there's A 25% chance they'll come back pregnant with an alien baby! :D

I say this because i think id rather have my sims at home do useful activities for more moneyyy. Also the introduction of aliens is something i dont really use, I do like playing with aliens but i really hate creating an alien sim, since i either have to make 2 different sims or leave one with not so pretty clothes, but ig theres nothing u can do abt that. Then for the retail stores, it is fun to own one, although you need to be in the retail lot to be able to open the store (get money lmao) And i think that makes it rlly annoying, since its after all just a different kind of live job. After buying this i used it like 5 times in some generations gameplay but then i stopped using aliens and retails, sometimes i do go back to playing with the careers but as i said sometimes i feel like its more useful to stay at home. Also sometimes some careers dont really explain to you what to do, or where to do some stuff and you end up spending the whole time you have to work, in trying to do that action that you are asked to do, and then later you gain less money for doing less stuff. . .. .

I found that the buggier careers were the detective and doctor fields. There was one bug that experience breaking in the Detective field. Sometimes the sim you arrest would not show up to the jail cell and the mission would be ruined. The Scientist career offers a lot, and is by far my favorite! You get the Sim Ray which can be used to control sims minds, freeze them, prank them, etc. You can also transform objects and make lots of money from the items that transform into higher quality objects. You can also get abducted and communicate with aliens. Eventually, through this field, aliens will feel more comfortable walking around the world without a disguise. It's pretty interesting.

This is actually one of the best dlc's for Sims 4. As the name implies it adds the ability to actually go to work and do your job. Unfortunately it only includes three professions – detective, doctor and scientist. But it's better than nothing. If you wanted to actually work this dlc is for you.

But professions are not everything. You can now be self employed and own a retail store. Combine this dlc with Dine Out and you can have a restaurant. Switching between restaurant and retail store is really fun and brings variety into managing your business. Just one downside – your businesses are not active while you're at home. They can only be opened when you are actually there.

Retail stores are really fun since you can sell anything, nearly every item could be sold in your store. You can sell clothes by placing mannequins and putting clothes on them (sadly only up to 8 mannequins are allowed). The fun part is that you can design the clothes yourself.
Don't like clothing store? Sell the paintings, you paint yourself, can do that even at work and sell the paintings in your gallery.
Want something else? Sell food, open a bakery. With bakery skill it's now possible. While restaurants (from Dine Out) are for serving food, retail stores could be used for selling food.

You also need to hire employees and manage them. You can assign tasks to them, pay for their training, promote them, check on them, praise and criticize them. You can even design their uniforms.
Managing the store is pretty easy. You'll need to clean it, restock items and manage the prices. Besides that you can talk with your customers and try to talk them into buying stuff.
For each sale you get points which you can spend on retail perks which have various effects like cheaper restocking, easier to make a sale, ability to hire more employees and so on.
And lastly there are advertising campaigns you buy which will bring more customers.
Designing your retail store is up to you and your imagination, there are plenty of items to make it to your liking.
So capabilities are pretty good and this expansion brings a lot of variety into the game.

There are some downsides but if you play Sims 4 you shouldn't be bothered by it because you should be used to it. The downside is dumb AI. Your retail workers will behave like idiots, they will be constantly caught in group chatting and not doing their job. But there's a mod which fixes it to some extent. It also enables checkout at the counter. I've been using it for some time now and it works great. Your workers do their tasks and even checkout the customers and my sim is able to spend all the time helping the customers and trying to sell them something.

I wish there would be more professions, more variety like babysitter, barista, masseuse or others. I mean where you would actually do tasks.
Some crazy idea – I wish there would be a homeless profession. That would be fun, roaming the streets, sleeping at parks, begging for money and food while taking care of your dog. Maybe stealing from rich people at night or just starting fires as a revenge to society which abandoned you. That would be so fun.

Other than that as usual this dlc brings a lot of new items, clothing, build items, decorations. Most of them are related to the theme of this dlc but having more variety is always good.
Oh I almost forgot, you can also set up a photo studio and take photos of people and then sell the photos at your store.

Overall a very good dlc, still overpriced so buy on sale or in a bundle only! If you think you lack all this stuff in your sim life it's worth it. Keep in mind that if your playstyle isn't focused on working and making money by actually spending time on that, you won't have much fun or benefit from this dlc. All the businesses require a lot of time, it's tiring, your sim will become fat and if you don't enjoy going to work and rather spend time with friends, partying all day or doing something else this is not for you. Some people imply they need ALL the dlc for full experience but they are just trolls. This dlc has a very clear theme and isn't mandatory for a lot of people.",Recommended

1385,Get_To_Work 리뷰,"Compared to other expansions, I would rate this one low priority. There's a lot in it, but it also does feel fairly thin compared to the others.

Aliens are a MASSIVE disappointment. In my opinion they are the worst life state in Sims 4 - They effectively just glow their emotions and get a lot of negative emotions for people discovering they're aliens. Having an alien form and a customizable disguise is mostly just a huge annoyance for having to manage two looks for a character. There is no functional purpose to really switch between them - My alien that never uses his disguise gets discovered as an alien just as often as my aliens that live in their disguises.

The businesses are pretty cool. They can be a decent source of income, and are actually pretty fun and interactive. Not something I use on every household, but you probably could because they just kind of sit and wait patiently if you forget them.

The interactive jobs are not really my thing. There's nothing wrong with them, but I do tend to play larger households and I tend to prefer rabbit hole jobs to have less Sims needing management at one time. They are more fitting on smaller households where you would otherwise be on max speed a lot.",Recommended

Traits and Aspirations fall short as always, and there's some furniture peppered in, as well. I find myself using the furniture on the regular.

I cannot recommend this DLC despite its almost fundamental status with some mods and other DLC. The product approach that EA and Maxis are using but not fulfilling make this a frustrating buy. If the active careers were better, or if the game added more than 3 after the 40 dollar asking price, I could say it's perhaps worth it.

1404,에코라이프 리뷰,"DISCLAIMER: Never get any Sims 4 packs at full price, as none of EA's products deserve that much of your wallet
I have bought all of my packs on sale and waiting for them to go on sale is worth it.

That being said, this expansion pack is one of the strongest Sims 4 packs!
My preferred way to play is: Maxis-Match, Laid-Back/Slice-of-Life, Gameplay over Build/Buy and CAS.

========
Build/Buy: 9.5/10

Eco Lifestyle's Build/Buy is incredibly beautiful; A modern, 3D-printed style to everything. Everything is aesthetically pleasing. I love filling my homes with plants and having natural lighting, and this pack's Build/Buy works so well with that aesthetic. I use Eco Lifestyle's Build/Buy objects in all of my builds.
========
CAS: 8/10

Eco Lifestyle's CAS is so cozy; Nice jeans and sweaters with softer color palettes. Some of the clothes are very patchy, like they've been up-cycled and that aesthetic works so well with a Rags-to-Riches play through! I find the pixie cuts and curls to be very nice, but aside from those hairstyles, I find the rest of the hair to be okay. I believe this pack comes with no makeup, but it comes with facial piercings which look fine. CAS objects hit more than they miss in this pack.
========
Gameplay: 7.5/10

Most Sims 4 packs have little to no gameplay, and this pack barely passes that bar. You're able to vote on N.A.Ps or Neighborhood Action Plans which can give your world buffs or nerfs depending on what gets voted in. I know a lot of people get annoyed by this feature, as if you forget to vote, something random can get voted in. However, I find it a fine mechanic, it's like paying your bills. It's easy enough to gain enough renown to vote and usually, whatever you vote seems to get passed as long as you make it the majority (which usually only takes 3-4 votes).
Aside from that, there is the Community Space, fabricator and candle maker. I have not messed with candle making, but it seems cute. The fabricator is very pleasing to use and makes very nice furniture and upgrade parts to make your household appliances more eco-friendly! Unfortunately, I could not figure out Juice Fizzing, but I think the idea is very cool.
The Community Space is solely reliant on how you vote, and honestly? It's pretty cool. Similar to Stardew Valley, how you vote decides if your community space is eco-friendly or more industrial. I haven't gone into the depths on how it works, but I am currently on the eco-friendly track, and it was very cool when I went to a community lot in Evergreen Harbor to dumpster dive/vote and I suddenly find the place more gussied up and cleaner! It was a nice surprise and made my voting seem worth it. However, I believe the voting effecting the world is strictly closed off to Evergreen Harbor, which is fine since I like the world, but if you don't like the world, you will get nothing out of it unless you visit.
========
World: 8/10

Evergreen Harbor is not done justice when you solely look at the 2D map. The residential lots are either plain canvases or colorful, wacky builds (both have incredibly strong foundations to build upon). The neighbors look great and are very pleasant. If you're interested in playing the pre-made families stories, the lore is very bare bones but there's enough there to build upon for us slice-of-life simmers. The old, lesbian couple have the nicest house and are very cute. I adore them!",Recommended
1405,에코라이프 리뷰,"More than 3 years later and most of the features this pack adds stuff doesn't work. None of the new generators actually give your house any power. If you look online for answers, some will say that generators do provide power but it is only a tiny bit, but i just installed 100 of them in a lot as a test and could not power a single lamp.............................",Not Recommended

1407,에코라이프 리뷰,"If you want your sims to have real polyamory, this is the pack for you (info at end of review).
If you want your sims to live off-grid AND be able to make salads, this DLC is compulsory (why on earth do salads require electricity???)

- I love the new power & water generation options, although I hate the process of making ""eco upgrade"" parts.
- You can dumpster dive for food and objects, as well as nap and woohoo in dumpsters.
- There are new things to create on the woodwork bench, and with the new fabricator machine which runs off of scraps from bins.

The aesthetics are great, although as someone big into self sufficiency it is really strange to me that you can't insulate your house, don't have more choices for walls and floors (eg compacted dirt floor), and don't have any kind of water filtering system.

This would also have been a great pack to introduce an outdoor wood-fired oven and maybe a rocket stove.

These would be great additions because: without electricity you cannot bake anything in the stoves that already exist, so it would be great to have a wood-fired oven. A rocket stove is a very very small and very efficient fireplace, it would be the perfect non-electrical alternative to the space heaters introduced in Snowy Escape. It would only take one square, instead of the multiple squares that a full sized fireplace takes.


* Regarding polyamory and community action plans:
There is a new gameplay mechanic (community action plans) which allows you to vote each week. You're voting on what lifestyles your entire neighbourhood will live; eg ""free love"" = no jealousy or cheating, you can actually have multiple partners without them getting upset at you all the time (as long as you're in a neighbourhood that has this action plan active).
There are a limited number of action plans, and some are connected (eg there's one where people don't like technology, but are also prudish about woohoo). But when there are 4 action plans in place, no new ones will be voted in unless you vote to repeal one (I've never had an NPC initiate a repeal). So you can set up the four you want and then ignore the whole system.

I saw reviews about community action plans not working properly, but I haven't had any problems with it.
I had certain action plans in place when my sim lived in the city, and even after moving away that neighbourhood seems to have kept the same action plans, so it is a feasible way to customise each neighbourhood in a way that actually impacts visitors to that neighbourhood.",Recommended

1409,에코라이프 리뷰,"Pros: Overall, I like the gameplay (including new CaS and lot traits) from this pack in my personal opinion are fun that make this pack unique in comparison to other packs.
More apartments
I like the build items.
Good for a rags to riches challenge especially with the ""Freegan"" trait.
Interesting CaS items that perhaps a poor or homeless sim could wear and interesting new neighbors.

Cons: Neighborhood Action Plans are mandatory.
I noticed that in the past the dumpster was bugged and concerned that it might be still bugged.
It finally comes with a five expansion pack bundle, but still cheaper with the 50% discount even with a bundle. For some people this pack may not be worth getting when it is not on sale.

Mixed: Overall, CaS has some good items, but overall I would give it 6.5 out of 10. I do not think that I like CaS as much from Eco Lifestyle in comparison to some of the other packs, but not bad at the same time.

Conclusion: I think that this could be a fun pack for anyone who really enjoys playing The Sims 4 overall and overall I would recommend this, but at the same time not necessarily one of the first packs someone should buy and not recommended either for people who do not think that they would enjoy the mandatory neighborhood action plans either.",Recommended

Ever-green harbor had so much potential but allot of the lots are just ugly and isolated and unpleasent to play on.

- good new world
- apartments!
- lots of cute build/buy
- lots of cute CAS
- community lots and community voting feature is cool
- new crafting opportunities (fabrication, juice fizzing, candle making)

cons:
- eco footprint feature is a cool idea but not as well executed as it could be. the difference between the industrial, neutral, and green is honestly pretty minimal aside from mood/buff effects. there will still be a bunch of trash in the industrial part of evergreen harbor even if you get it into green. also, if you don't purposely go out of your way and try to change the eco footprint, it will not change at all, which could be a pro or a con for you depending on your gameplay.

overall, one of the better packs for this game and has pretty good value. as always tho, wait for a sale before buying",Recommended

I would recommend any other expansion before this one unless you want this specifically for clothes/build items.",Not Recommended
1419,에코라이프 리뷰,"This expansion pack makes me feel older than the target audience for this game (which I probably am, Sims 4 as a whole is heavily focused on Gen Z, so even as a Millennial this is not the only pack that makes me feel outdated). From Freegan (please Google it) to Juice Fizzing (Sims Kombucha), I do not connect with any of the main themes of this pack, nor the RL parallel perspective from which broader ideas were implemented. Such as it's not *just* dumpster diving, it is taken to its most extreme: Freeganism.
The best thing about this pack is that its big features come with settings to turn them off.

Neighborhood Action Plans (NAPs) are mostly either horrendously buggy or else infuriating by design. There are a very small number of useful NAPs, but they are bland flat skill boosts. NAPs are also the source of the notorious ""white cake bug"", where your Sims as well as NPCs will constantly autonomously go to your kitchen and SPAM out white cakes. Never any other flavor, just white cake.

The Eco Footprint system is overwhelmingly obnoxious, as it arbitrarily slaps ""industrial footprint"" on MANY very nice BB items. This ends up forcing you to either overload with ""green"" items, or else suffer the neighborhood becoming ""industrial"" and having a permanent smog cloud and huge debuffs for being outside. While the buffs for having a green neighborhood are pretty nice (and VERY strong), this feature prompts you to not use a massive swath of your build catalog, and when you own every pack that means wasting hundreds of RL dollars worth of content by not using them. With that being the result of this system, I consider this the worst feature design in the entirety of Sims 4.

Evergreen Harbor is the most hideous world in the game. Grims Quarry and Conifer Station do capture a very authentic feeling of modern urban life, but bluntly that is not what I am looking for in the Sims - There are MANY very different games that do that, do it better, and do it with a Mature rating for more authenticity. When that is what I want, I play those games instead of Sims.
The up side here is that Evergreen Harbor is the second world with apartments. These apartments are fairly large, and the rent is cheap, so they are well suited to starter families (for which the City Living cheap apartments are mostly too small).

Most of the BB and CAS are really ugly, as they are meant to be recycled, repaired, and repurposed items and clothing. The Fabricated items have the minimum comfort, and thus give the uncomfortable debuff - The buy catalog items are generally not better. The up side is that these items are typically the actual cheapest options, so they are useful for furnishing out starter homes, dorms, etc.
There are some stand out amazing BB items to point out though. The Vertical Garden Planter is a wonderful garden space saver, and THE best item for indoor gardening and greenhouses. Also, the Solar Panels and Wind Turbines are great to add to any and every build, they give a great modern touch to homes and reduce your bills. These items also make the Off The Grid lot challenge a lot more fleshed out, as you can use these to generate your own electricity and have consistent access to electric items. There are also water collectors.

Community Space lots are one of the most forgotten features in the game, as you have to live in the same neighborhood as the lot to vote for it to be one of the three useful sub-assignments. Once set, the lot can be used by any Sim from any neighborhood, but this is generally too out of the way to be worthwhile. Changing the sub-assignment can be done once it's set to something useful, but there's really no point to do so.
Once you've gone to the trouble to set these up, the Marketplace and Community Garden are useful lot types. The Marketplace is like a consistent flea market, and easy to pick up collectible items and whatever else NPCs sell on the tables. At the Community Garden, NPCs will arrive in droves to place any and every random plant in the game into the planters. Stuff the lot with planters. Profit. All of the Community Space lots can be edited easily while your sim is visiting the lot, without having to go to Manage Neighborhood mode.

Fabrication is a disappointing skill, and I really did not want it to be. As already mentioned, most of the items it creates are very low quality and will make your Sims unhappy. Also, this one skill has been broadly applied to the VERY unrelated Juice Fizzing, Candle making, and the Fabricator (basically large scale 3D printing). These should have each been their own skills. The Fabricator breaks often, and fails to print constantly, even at maxed out Fabrication. You have to do a LOT of recycling to feed Fabrication, and randomly also Candle making. Because of all of this, the Crafter (Fabrication) branch for Freelancer is too obnoxious to be playable.

Death by flies is so disgusting that it made me nauseous - For which I will actually give this death type a 9/10. That is a feat, aaaaand I probably will not use that death again. Death by Beetles, on the other hand, is a delightful easter egg / homage.",Not Recommended

1430,에코라이프 리뷰,"I think this pack is unique and creative, and the concept is out of the box thinking for the sims team. I obviously like the pack, and I will name the pros, cons, addressing concerns over the pack, and game play options of the game.

Pros:
- It introduced a new way to build homes. Ex: Living in storage containers, and an eco home.
- I really like the build/buy options. You can create these beautiful plant-based modern homes.
- I actually like the CAS clothing because I like the more eccentric clothing.
- There's different game play options (listed below).
- I enjoy the challenges and humor in the community action plans.
- For people who love apartments, there are 2 I can think of.

Cons:
- The careers aren't that interesting as it's pretty much like other careers. I would've loved to be more involved in them. Especially with the Civil Engineer, I would've wanted to see my work make changes to the environment.
- There is no good/evil play style in this game. Ex: You can make the world healthier, but you can't make the world dirtier.
- I suggest getting this pack on a really good sale, as I don't agree with how much they charge for packs/kits.

Game play:
- This has dumpster diving, which means you can make your home with the furniture you got from the dumpster; so a rags to riches challenge. The only downfall of this, is that I find that I sometimes can't use the items even after repairing them, so it's a bug (what a surprise...). But you don't make decent money from dumpster diving so you could replace those items.
- If you're into it, you can also make some furniture and candles. I didn't bother with this as I didn't like the furniture.
- Because this game comes with trash and broken furniture, you can access hidden furniture through debug (look it up as I can't remember how to do this lol), and you can make some trashy looking homes which is fun for if you want to build a run down home.
- And of course there's the normal way of playing this pack, which is to make the world smog-free!

Addressing concerns:
- ""All the lots have houses, there's no empty lot"" You could bulldoze a lot of your choice.

1438,에코라이프 리뷰,"Been playing the Sims series since 2000 - for over two decades now. I know there's tons of thoughts and feelings on all of the different iterations but just focusing on this eco expansion: it's kind of wild.

On the bright side, there's some interesting mechanics introduced (like rallying the community together to make eco-friendly changes in a neighborhood). On the down side, it's painting a weird stereotype of people who are interested in the environment (only ear gages, only beanies, only people who dig through the trash to get recyclables out...)

More importantly, the message communicated is that you have to consume more in order to recycle more and get your Bits and Pieces. Which freaks me out a ton. 

Gameplay-wise, though, it's a solid expansion in terms of new gameplay options introduced and items. So. If you're looking for an interesting expansion, I recommend it. If you're looking for something that makes you feel good about environmentalism - ehhhhh.

Just install a bit of grunge, dystopian, or post-apocalyptic CC, and enjoy making your Sims work for their comforts.",Recommended
1444,에코라이프 리뷰,"This is probably the most challenging pack. It made me take a U-turn from playing the other Cities and Towns. Totally different experience here. You basically have to transform the whole town to be eco friendly. There's 3 areas in the town to do it. There's a Gauge that tells you if your moving towards of being Green or Industrial. I would suggest trying to re-trait the NPC's and playing them by making them recycle and be more eco friendly as the regular traits make them cook, use electronics and don't care about the environment. The issued NPC's are fun to play with so you don't need to make your own sims. This pack has so much to deal with which IMO makes it one of the best packs. You can literally spend days if not weeks or months trying to transform your town.
3 Things that makes this pack good:
1. New Traits.
2. New Careers
3. A ton of content from Solar panels, to windmills, to recycled clothing. You can even make eco friendly furniture.
As far as Residential Lots, you have 7 and 4 Apartment Units so a total of 11. 4 transformable Community Lots are also available. Those are also ECO focused. This pack work well with other packs as well especially the Tiny Living pack. Because of this pack eco content, you can use the eco stuff in other towns and cities which in turn, will save money on utilities.",Recommended
1445,에코라이프 리뷰,"I bought this pack thinking that I was going to experience an environmentalist utopia. What I got was a version of the base game that looks like the sims are rebuilding after the zombie apocalypse. Visually Evergreen Harbor is very unimpressive, especially the docks. This pack implements a few interesting concepts like: Voting for different initiatives to impact your eco footprint, changes in the environment based on what you vote for and how much power and water you use, being able to recycle stuff in order to create stuff you already have or don't need. The new careers are also fantastic and pay well, the activities also make you feel as though you are making a difference in the world. The goal of a ""green fiend"" is to contribute to a greener environment by following a strict set of rules. You may have to live without certain commodities (if you care about the environment) like TVs, computers, electronics, etc. You could also live in a crummy ""off-the-grid"" home (I definitely do not recommend) and have your power and water shut off regularly. However, you can combat your footprint by planting trees, using wind and solar power, and also conserve water. Sometimes your effect doesn't make much sense, for example, last night I was playing and a random old lady sim told me that the trees told her about my small TV and computer destroying the ecosystem. So she came over and literally destroyed both of them until I had beat her up to leave my house. It sure was interesting, but my plan is to move my sims out of the harbor ASAP.

Edit: After a lot more gameplay, I've decided to change my recommendation to ""Yes"". I'm doing this because I've realized that while a few aspects of this pack can be a little annoying, it really is a well built pack! You can vote in other areas of the world, but the green initiatives don't affect them at all. However, you can vote for N.A.Ps that give your sim a significant boost in salary, or something like that. I love the new career, Civil Designer, it's one of the best that I've experienced in the game. My sim is almost never at work because the work from home assignments are very simple and take almost no time at all. I mentioned previously that the world looks like the sims are rebuilding after the apocalypse, that was a slight exaggeration of one of the areas in the harbor. The 2 of the 3 areas are actually rather quaint. They're not exceptionally different from the base game world, but they are really nice with the added green initiatives. Comparing this pack to others available, I have to say, it's a lot higher on my list than I initially implied. Definitely recommend... when it's on sale, obviously.",Recommended
1446,에코라이프 리뷰,"Another money-grab by EA.

The new world is small and highlights the lack of big-picture thinking by EA. You get several pre-created lots to work with, and the ones in the container port area are pretty cool and creative. The new objects added to the game are nice as well and make for good / fun additions.

However, there are no empty building plot included with this world. There is one apartment building with two units (both fully furnished and equipped - Why not give us two empty units or a floor with two empty units in the same building?) The container port would really benefit from some empty lots where we could create our own modular container homes. And the main residential area has 16 pre-populated houses in it, none of which can be played. Hey, its nice to see all the neighbors houses, but why not make those actual playable lots? You already did all the work designing them, why not let us edit them or replace them with our own creations?

One of the things I really used to enjoy was creating my own neighborhoods with 10-15 houses that I created/designed. unfortunately this is no longer possible. It seems that EA is determined to force everyone into playing their way, and this Expansion Pack simply highlights that.

I guess you could tear down the pre-created buildings, but that still only gives you creative control over a very small area / slice of the world.",Not Recommended
1447,에코라이프 리뷰,"My personal favorite expansion pack for the Sims 4!

First off, I recommend purchasing Tiny Living Stuff with this DLC as quickly when using solar and wind power along with trying to collect water, your sim will quickly be adding up bills.
Hand in hand this DLC is for both builders and those who play most only live mode. The CAS stuff is depressing but the windows, plants, wall colors and other items are usable even in a majorly modded out game. You can create an assortment of beautiful homes and even unique creations such as underground vaults with a bit of imagination.
As far as playing with the live mode additions, it is suit for gardening sims, art sims, and any career that relies on self-employed aspirations. I have yet to clean up the new world, but each area offers a distinct feel and really feels like something out of the Hunger Games district 12. The ability to grow plants different ways as well as harvesting bugs as an alternate protein. The vegan in me is bias as I wanted to see something more than just recycling to reach a cleaner community. One important note is that npcs will if enabled vote randomly on the neighborhood boards which can result in annoying occurrences such as the desire to randomly fight any sim. It will end up making your sim get into fights every few seconds of the game, so I recommend turning this option off in settings.
The map is stunning primarily as I find it very minimalist and love the quarry area as it reminds me of Fallout 4, but it can very much be unexciting as it is a toned-down neighborhood as compared to the City living world. The pollution aspect is easily ignored, and I felt no obligation to change the different areas.
My main tip would be to put the solar panels on roofing only as you do not have to clean or fix them constantly!
Using other DLC’s I created this Barn and used it to sell my plants as well as décor items in the harbor area.",Recommended

The new location is sweet, with a lot of nice NPC Sims and functionality (faires, contests, etc., helping your neighbors with chores and more). It definitely pushes for off-the-grid, quiet living. Bracing breezes to spend time outside and Foxes as a lot challenge are fun, and the wildlife is super funny. Foxes singing songs with you is one of my favorite.

The farm animals you can raise have very cute animations and purposeful interactions as well. It does take a LOT of focus to keep up with a job, gardening, and watching over animals, so it's helpful having a small area of more hands to provide assistance. Overall one of my favorite expansion purchases to date.",Recommended

I downloaded it and as soon as i began to play it was fine then hit a wall of bugs. To the point if i try to leave the new area it freezes on the loading screen of death and I have reset my entire computer. I have tried so many things to get it to work and I even removed my mods to see if that could be it but nope. Just avoid this expansion for now. Seems like they haven't fixed it at all....

1462,코티지 라이프 리뷰,"I enjoyed it at first, but it has a lot of bugs that affect gameplay (I don't currently use outside mods, so I know these aren't causing anything). One of the biggest bugs I've come across is that I never seem to be able to get the hatchable eggs to hatch. They say they're don't spoil for almost a day, but I swear that they spoil quicker, and if they are still hatchable after that, the sim will clean them out before I can stop them. I've also run into an issue where I put my cow in my inventory for the cow festival, and after the festival is over, I haven't been able to put them back in the animal shed. I can't drag it from my inventory, there's no option when I click on it in my inventory, and the animal shed doesn't have any option other than buying a new one.

It was disappointing the lack of actual farm-y or cottage-y animals there was, and I really want to see more of the whole farm-y vibe, as a farmer myself!

The pack offers excellent outfits, builds, skills, and traits! Although it kind of sucks that you have to pay for this pack to make your sim lactose intolerant. It's funny, but sucks to consumers not to have that in the base game! I really love this pack though, and if there is anything that needs updating in the future, please update this pack!!

There is a lot trait option called simple living which means you have to actually go and buy the supplies to make your food and if you want to do cross-stitching then you need to have wool which you can buy or you can get from your lama.

Ngl the died by bunny and chicken is hilarious, was hopping that fox can kill your sims too lmao. Most importantly, Agnes Crumplebottom is back! The only thing I hate is how the village townie can die and we can't disable aging for them, I hate how those resident roles taken by random ugly townies.. sigh, well luckily not for Agatha and Agnes, but still it's annoying..

If you prefer having an outdoors Sim(s), tending a farm, or being a herbologist, it is great. There are some premade houses for painters. One has a great den/study for a writer. The addition of Foxes makes other worlds like the country side of Windenburg look nicer. If you have a bro Sim, Only issue, is lack of library and gym (I have a Sim who is a bookworm and a Sim with the bro trait)

It is great to visit. The theme of being rural England, animal husbandry, and the architecture, make it a fun addition.

Not only is the world/scenery lovely, and adds some fun and interesting game play, but the content of items in the packs are superb. The building lots are very varied, and all attractive. Father Christmas/Santa also unexpectedly resides in this world which is a nice twist. My one and only gripe about this pack is an issue that I know many players are frustrated with, and that the EA developers have never yet addressed and fixed, and it does spoil the game play: if you choose the option for your animals to not age up it does not work if you move that animal to a different location - whether that be simply taking the animal to compete at the Finchwick Fair, or because you move house with your animals, after which they will quickly become sick and die because the game doesn't recognise that you have actually taken them back out of your inventory!",Recommended

If you want to try out a new type of game play, one which does not involve big cities and being famous, cottage living is definitely worth buying. It adds some of the cutest CAS items, beautfiul and authentic build mode items and a tranquil world to your game. Taking care of animals and plants as well as becoming part of a close knit community are some of the best aspects of this pack. The NPCs added also feel a lot more real in this world.

1531,코티지 라이프 리뷰,"This was a pack I was really excited for....but ended up not really loving.
Below I will include reasons I wanted the pack and then what I ended up not liking about it.

1) The town and getting to know other sims:

-Unless you have your generated sims on low and play the game rarely using any of the speed buttons this part of the pack just feels very, very meh. Most of the time I forget it's an option. It will give a pop up every now and then hinting a villager needs help but if you're playing a family house or managing more than one sim it's so easy to forget.

2) Caring for a small amount of animals as a fun hobby, maybe some country living RP:

- Even one animal in your barn, which without cheats you can only have one at a time anyway (which I think is kinda dumb), is almost a full time job. Especially if you start out with low money or, again, have to manage more than one sim. This pack really makes you feel like you have to play a single person household to stay on top of the direction the pack is supposed to bring you.

3) The map is huge and pretty looking from the splash art:

- The map is huge and feels kind of empty in areas when you're actually playing. Everything feels kind of packed into the town and I wish there was a bit more to do in all those empty spaces.

4) The pack feels like it should have a hint of fantasy:

- Well, guess what? There's not really. There's more mention of gnomes and pixies in CITY living",Not Recommended

1535,코티지 라이프 리뷰,"It's not even worth it on sale. My game keeps glitching and has never done so before downloading this pack. It does not add or change the game-play as much as I expected.

I have tried to ""Clean the chicken coop"" three times in a row, and my sim just stands still and won't do anything. I can't even cancel the task. Restarting the game every time this happens is getting really annoying.

Occasionally, when interacting with animals or other sims, my sim will walk all the way down the hill passing by the other sim/animal, and then after going all the way back up to my house, either do the interaction or it will cancel the interaction and my game will start lagging.

I have tried removing all the mods and restarting my computer, but the problem is still there. This expansion pack has unmistakably done more harm than good for me.",Not Recommended

- there are very few new places to place new households; there's a new neighborhood but that one's almost filled wall-to-wall with pre-existing Sims
- owning farm animals (lamas, cows, chicken) is horrifically time-consuming, it pretty much puts an end to anything else you might want your Sims to do.
The animals need something _all_ the time, especially if you couldn't make up your mind and got different ones. If you have Sims good at that, you can build in some upgrades so there are a few less tasks, but because there are extra conditions of those upgrades, _that_ takes for bloody ever, too, like one Sim week.
You could say it's realistic: if you have a farm, say goodbye to things like holidays or other interests.
But since one of the first EP I bough was ""Making Magic"", chances are I don't want perfect realism, thx ;)",Recommended

The additional plants and recipes it comes with are cool. Maybe it's just my game play style, but caring for the chickens, cows, llamas, etc was annoying, especially having to protect the chickens from the the foxes.

1557,코티지 라이프 리뷰,"Hands down my favorite pack they released. From cottagecore hairstyles, clothing pieces and accessories to themed build items and most importantly farm animals. You can choose to have chickens, roosters and/or cows and llamas.

I just love my llama rocking a stylish sweater. He does love long hugs but enjoys a good spit on occasion too Im afraid.

There is also the possibility to befriend rabbits, flock of birds and foxes that you can find in the world and on your lot. Each can later provide you with gifts and help on your farm. Rabbits will eat weeds, birds will eat bugs and foxes can be persuaded to stop stealing.

The pack also expands both gardening and cooking. You can now easily live off your own produce and even make a sweet buck if you choose to sell fruit, veggies or flowers. With cooking you now have a huge variety of pies to bake and canning was also added. This allows you to have jam, custard and syrup in jars from which your sims can even eat directly from.

The world is on the smaller side but fits perfectly in with the theme. It is divided into 3 sub zones, each with a bit of lore you discover running errands for the townies and sometimes even when just having a heart to heart discussion with them. 2 starter homes, 1 community lot, 1 travel in lot and 1 empty lot next to the townies residencies is what you'll find here. The town square also has a produce and a flower vendor. Each sunday there is a themed fair where you can compete with either your chicken, cow, llama, garden (pie and fruits or veggies) or oversized crops.

If you love the sims and farming, what are you waiting for? Its definitely worth it.

1576,코티지 라이프 리뷰,"Buggy. Right from the get go I've had more issues with this DLC than any other thus far for Sims 4. I've had the music break on the earbuds, where you turn it on, it sounds muffled and static (like bad reception, or was that intentional for the country side?), and when you turn them off, it doesn't. You have to completely log out of the game to get it to stop. I also cannot interact with many things, as I don't ""own"" them, even thought technically I should. I've given up on many errands for the villagers because I cannot turn in items. Its mostly when I have to make something like food, I can see it in my inventory but cannot turn it in. Or, raising animals only to ""not own them"", which can limit some options of what you can do with them. Also, interactions with animals can be tricky/not work, and you have to do it a lot to achieve certain goals. To me, its seems a little too much for farm animals.

Otherwise, I think the map is nice, and the prebuilt houses are better looking than some others. Although will put you on a tight budget to start on this map. And if you like foxes, you'll love the ones here.",Not Recommended

The new resources, like cows, llamas, chickens, and oversized vegetables allow sims to become self-sufficient. You are able to create your own success without waiting for your sim to come home from work. This is a perfect match with gardening, and I found that pairing this with Seasons was a dynamic experience. You can be apart of the community and help other sims with tasks, which is an interesting extension to the game. The shops in town will often sell rare fruit, which is awesome for gardening.

1593,코티지 라이프 리뷰,"TAKE YOUR TIME ON PLAYING THIS DLC. This is not a fast paced Expansion Pack. Took me awhile to get my farm going. The only stressful part was the Wild Foxes getting in the way but you can work your way around it. So many things to do in this pack. You can basically seclude yourself from the normal world by living and farming on your own. It's totally opposite of City Living and Getting Together. This is more focused on family rather than friends. It's charming tbh. The only drawback I didn't like about this DLC was the lack of clothes for Males. There's no shorts or pants to choose from. Other than that, it's rich with building items. I suggest making friends with the wild bunnies and birds before you start farming. Dogs and Cats pack helped me alot because the Foxes don't like to deal with domestic pets. I had my dogs run around and the foxes would not get get near my Chicken Pen. There's about 10 Lots to choose from and 3 of them are 50x40. If you're looking for a Lot pack, this is it. Other Expansion packs may have more but doesn't compare to the Lot sizes. My favorite Expansion Pack was City Living, but this one is probably going to be my favorite.",Recommended
1594,코티지 라이프 리뷰,"Llama!
This is an incredibly fun pack with so many different options and ways to play it. Henford on Bagley is almost immediately one of my new favorite neighborhoods, it's incredibly beautiful with a nice addition of several large lots. I love playing with gardening, and of the several expansions that enhance gardening I do have to say that so far Cottage Living is the best at really growing your options.

Now, it's not all daisies and oversized pumpkins - I did want to note that there is poor cross over between Cottage Living and a couple of other expansion packs. First, and while I expected this I am no less disappointed about it, cats & dogs from the Cats & Dogs EP have almost *no* interaction with Cottage Living, specifically with the foxes and other animals included in the pack. Second is that the Seasons EP plays a little bit awkward with your farming. Cottage Living is about farming outside! Except Seasons makes it decidedly better to farm in a greenhouse or else graft everything you want onto the handful of year round base plants (like sage, lemon, etc). The one new normal plant (chocoberry) doesn't have seasons, and is very useful to have a TON of (unlike sage), so there's that at least. The new oversized plants also seem to ignore seasons - Which is both good because they have an expiration timer (so they would be ridiculously unavailable if they did have growth seasons), yet awkward since there's normal versions of those plants that do have seasons.
Seasons and Cats & Dogs are two of the most recommended first expansions for new or low budget players to pick up, and those two packs (particularly Seasons) usually work well with other packs. Sooo that's awkward. While I don't expect most packs to have high interaction between each other, most do at least stitch seams together where they meet up. These two meet up with Cottage Living (or had the potential to) all over, and kinda ... Don't.

As far as what works particularly well with this pack, Nifty Knitting and (of all things) Outdoor Retreat. Llama wool reduces the cost of knitting, just like it does cross stitching. Also you can knit animal clothes for your chickens etc! Outdoor Retreat's plants just keep showing up on the new vendors, and there's even canning recipes for some of them - Which isn't that special, I suppose, but Outdoor Retreat's content is otherwise so easy to completely ignore/miss, and it's a bit of new life for it.

I do love this pack, so I am very happy to recommend it to anyone considering it! I usually try to offer a priority for packs compared to other packs - since Sims 4 has MANY and the cost is very high. However since this pack interacts awkwardly with other high priority packs, I think I have to give it a split placement. Basically, if any this pack's big features particularly appeal to you - The map, llamas, chickens, cows, wild rabbits, general aesthetic, gardening *outside*, etc - then yes! This pack is for you, and it's terrific! Top tier priority, right next to Get Together, and maybe ahead of Seasons, or Cats & Dogs! (Depending on preference, particularly since the above on those two.)
If this pack isn't jumping out at you, however. If the most appealing way to play to you is in a San Myshuno apartment, or perhaps from a beach in Sulani sipping juice and relaxing, then you won't be missing much by skipping this pack (or letting it languish near the bottom of your priority list). It adds very little if you are focused on playing some other aspect of the game.",Recommended

1605,삶과 죽음 리뷰,"I got this expansion primarily for interactions with the grim reaper. Which, sure, this allowed. I like a portion of the CAS and a lot of the build/buy items, they've been really pretty. I cannot recommend this pack though. When having a sim start in the reaper career, the tasks every other day were broken, making the workday unfinishable. On the very first day at her new job, none of the bodies would appear in the building. She couldn't even START doing her house-visit reaping. Grim couldn't find them either. On another day, one out of four of the bodies simply didn't exist. I scoured the entire plot, several times over trying to find this thing, to no avail. The only option on BOTH of these occasions was to send her home early, which obviously defeats the whole damn point. These bugs make that career path unplayable. This is one of the first dlc I picked up after starting to play this game again, despite hearing from a friend how broken and bugged this game is. I didn't believe him, and I should have. It's frankly embarrassing that the sims team, and more importantly, EA continuously allow DLC to roll out severely bug-ridden content and at this steep of a price point. On a separate note, as other reviewers have pointed out, the new world and stories feel kind of... empty? What struck me as the most odd is that the graveyard's graves are ALL empty - none of the other sims get buried there - and visiting sims are just... mourning at empty, unclaimed graves. The amount of purchasable homes that are not already occupied in Ravenswood is also disappointing. You'd think for a DLC that costs the same amount as the game when it first came out you'd be getting a little more bang for your buck here. If you really want this dlc, get it on sale. And be warned, there is a significant chance any of the grim reaper's kids will have zero chins. And I mean NO chin or jaw bone. Maybe my sims just got unlucky.... but three kids and the one common denominator being Grim? The odds are not looking good for him.",Not Recommended
1606,삶과 죽음 리뷰,Overall a very pretty good concept the new jobs are a great addition to the game. I will say I do own all of the expansion packs and most of the stuff packs and play with mods. In my opinion the new jobs are more fun compared to back to work pack. The people who complain that the tasks are dull its the sims there has always been tasks and they have never been well thought out. The create a sim is not all that compared to the build buy stuff that was added. It is nice that you are able to be a ghost for once and not have a random time and place your household member spawns. Being able to resurrect as a new sim is one of the most interesting parts of this pack. The new map is probably the most detailed compared to all of the expansion packs. I would definitely get this when it's on sale unless you have the funds and really enjoy the Sims.,Recommended

1614,삶과 죽음 리뷰,"I pre ordered TS; L&D and have played it solidly over the last week or so. Overall I like this expansion, the Build items are stunning and I like the CAS options as well.

The two new careers (reaper and mortician) are...just okay. I found the reaper career a bit buggy. (dead sims or spirits not spawning correctly ) and honestly after a week sims time, the career is a bit boring and repetitive. I was also disappointed that the Mortician career is not a 'profession'. I was hoping you would be able to travel to the Graveyard and do things there, maybe even host funerals? Tend graveyard plots, assign plots to sims etc. Perhaps there is a third career in this pack I'm unaware of?

The new town Ravenwood is visually gorgeous. I find the festivals a little overwhelming and forget which ones are which, and then there is also the Ghost counselling sessions which I forget when they even are in game.

I think my BIGGEST problem with this game is the lack of backstory/lore with the new (and returning) sim families.

Take the Specter family for example. Olive's family tree shows no dead ex-husbands, yet their graves are just outside of her house, all stating they were her ex husbands but she doesn't know them or mourn the graves. The graves however on her lot are empty??. Also her son Nyon ( which I believe is suppose to be a new version of Nervous Subject from Sims 2) has no father, even though he is suppose to be Grim's baby. This has made the entire family seem like an empty shell. Where's the backstory? This is one of the iconic houses from TS2 - they can't NOT have a backstory or family tree.

Another house I will use as an example is the Aether household. One is a special member in a society and owns a gorgeous gothic mansion, you'd think this house would be one of the influential households in the map like the Goths in Willow Creek .... but once again they have no backstory. No family tree. So who are they?

And don't get me started on Lady Ravendancer Goth not being on their family tree either? Or Agnes Crumblebottom for that matter.

So i would say- get this pack when it is in a good sale, but don't expect anything thoroughly exciting. The family's and towns are all empty shells.",Not Recommended

CAS: 6/10
The overall vibe of CAS is very Gothic/dark academia vibes with a decent amount of options for Masculine and Feminine sims. I think there were some items I really liked but they definitely felt like they fit one aesthetic. I do wish there were more hair options, and a little more variety in hair texture. I don't mind CAS- but I wouldn't purchase this pack specifically for that.

Build/Buy: 10/10
I absolutely love the items that came in this pack. You can find something to furnish any type of room, and the style is just gorgeous. I found a lot of items that will likely become staples in other builds unrelated to this pack. Overall it felt really really cohesive and complete.

World: 8/10
The world is just beautiful, and rather large. You have a few lots to choose to build in and I'm pretty happy with the choices. I do wish there was a little more items to fill it in.

Gameplay: 6/10
The gameplay is where I am most conflicted. I think adding playable ghosts is awesome, I like the abilities you get- I don't think you should have to pay $40 to have access to it. The rebirth option I think would be amazing for legacy challenges and/or if you are someone who loves playing families. However A LOT of the features of this game are just task oriented. You are clicking, and traveling between loading screens to complete things and have access to other features of the game. I like this pack, don't get me wrong. But do I think the content you get is worth $40? Not really.
I understand if you're like me and just want to have those features and decide to buy it anyway. But if you are iffy on the concept, or don't mind the wait, I really do recommend waiting for this to go on sale before purchasing.",Recommended

The wills are a nice touch as is the heirlooms. Now the cherry on the top for me is the Souls journey which adds so much depth to each sim.
I may be biased because of my belief in reincarnation, but for me it's a huge part of life, so this adds something vital to the gameplay I was previously missing. Haven't yet played with the ghosts to a huge extent but I look forward to doing so; I love a good well-rounded occult.

Superb CAS, my vampires never looked so suave, amazing build/buy for spooky builds and abandoned places. And a beautiful mysterious world to explore that is full of unique interactions and gameplay.

This is the first expansion I bought full price and I'm glad I did. So much gameplay, so many new interactions and the bucket list is great. Let's be real, most expansions can be completed in a single day without adding much, this is going to take months to get through with regular play. The expansion that makes all other expansions look bad.

1626,삶과 죽음 리뷰,"This is what a Sims 4 expansion pack needs to be. TS$ Life and Death brings a whole new world of Ravenwood, a dreary, Romanian-inspired town, with tons of new gameplay, a new live career (plus a rabbit-hole career), new events and festivals. If you were to buy a pack at full price, this is worth it.

Pros:
- New live career
- Collectible Questline
- Build/Buy Catalog
- New lot type (Cemeteries)
- Playable ghosts
- Bucket List
- World

Meh:
- Festivals (Conflicts with live career sometimes)
- Funeral events
- Heirlooms and wills

Cons:
- Lack of different lot sizes (No small and huge lots)
- The downtown can feel empty sometimes (compared to Henford-on-Bagley)

CAS is fine, mostly formal wears, BBS are nice too, the only weird thing is there's only 1 new flooring. Gameplay aspect, the wills, funerals, cemetery, inherits, griefs, and more.. The world again is actually a big issue for most new packs, there's only 13 lots (+1 NWDD secret lot), wish there's more, but at least the world has a lot of things to do, especially the new festivals (though it's not really as interesting as the one from City Living), the world is pretty much alive all the time. Is it worth for the money? Honestly, all packs are expensive, it's better to wait for the discount, compared to other recent expansions, this one offers a lot and it's worth it to call it an 'expansion pack'.

allso there a reaper career and you can woohoo the grim reaper and have a grimborn which is a new type of sim.

This is honestly one of the better expansions I think EA has made for this game. You can buy lots, build them out and either be a slumlord or a super cool landlord who keeps your tenants happy. Do that for a bit and you'll soon be raking in the cash from all your rentals. Honestly adds a lot of depth to the game, and I haven't noticed any of the bugs other reviews are mentioning. Worth it imo.",Recommended
1655,북적북적 다세대 주택 리뷰,"So, I’ve been diving into The Sims 4 ""For Rent"" expansion pack, and I’ve got to say, it’s a pretty cool addition to the game. If you're into the idea of renting out spaces or living in some really stylish apartments, this pack might be right up your alley. Here’s what I think after spending some time with it.

This expansion brings in a whole new gameplay element with rental lots. You can now build and manage multi-family homes, which adds a neat twist if you’re into construction or want to see how well you can keep your tenants happy. The new world, Tomarang, is heavily influenced by Asian cultures, and it really shows in the design. There’s a super lively night market where your Sims can grab street food, and the community events are all about that vibrant, bustling atmosphere you’d find in real-life cities. It’s a fun addition and definitely makes the world feel more dynamic and immersive. Living close to other Sims means more opportunities for social drama. Whether it’s community potlucks or snooping on your neighbors, there’s a lot of potential for your Sims to get into some mischief. I found it hilarious when my Sim ended up blackmailing another Sim—definitely not something I expected, but it adds a bit of spice to the gameplay.

But if you’re not into micromanaging, the property aspect might get old fast. Keeping tenants happy, dealing with repairs, and making sure the rent gets paid can feel like a lot of work, especially if you’re more into the creative side of The Sims. Like with any new Sims content, there’s always a chance of running into bugs.",Recommended

Otherwise I love this game play aspect, as it lets you build a small community on any lot.

- The negative things is that: the world is very small, the parks or other public lots are not very interesting. The night market is cute and it the idea of it is very nice, but it did not meet my expectations. So if EA could add some extra details to the world, it could become better.

Those 3 apartments have tenants so at first I panicked how come I've lost my apartments and tenants.

But after I bought this pack I feel regret and happy in the same time I’m gonna explain why. (Also, I’ve played this pack for 4 days so, I wrote this based on my game play and personal thoughts)

Positive
-I really like the way they added the things for build and for dress base on real culture in South East Asia. Some furnitures are from my childhood I used to have them when I lived with my grandmother it’s heartwarming and brings back memories.
-I love the way sim greet each other in Tomarani greeting that surprised me a lot.(Also I love it. It’s how we greet in Thailand we call Wai)
-Nosy trait is also the best one here. We have a sentence “I’m Thai” or “Time to care” which real meaning is “I want to know other people business” lol.
-Marble Yes my childhood again lol.
-I love that Naka fountain but I can’t find and use it in my building sad:(

Negative
-First, in the town really boring like our night market may not that big but it’s not this small.. I don’t know it’s just sad you know.
-Also you have the whole town with South East Asia culture but no South East Asia festival like in snowy escape there are 3 festivals in 3 different places. For example I’m from Thailand maybe you can add Loy Katong festival or Songkran festival that would be nice and make gameplay more interesting or else why would you added sky lantern but no festival? (Who would release sky lantern in normal day)
-The build in some lots are really boring even the background building looks better. The park also look bad too…literally nothing in the park no chess table, no tree, no restroom, trash cans or even a fountain (in the lot) nothing just benches and grill and some bushes with flower.
-And what I get for build is really small amounts even though I said I like your detail buuuut but most of trees you used for decorate are from another packs I mean really? In South East Asia there aren’t no new trees or interesting trees for you to put game?? also it would make more sense if you add fan in this pack not only air condition. Trees for indoor aren’t that many options too(only four of them).

I didn’t faced any bugs like lagging or tenants won’t pay rent (they will pay like 5-7 days in my game so, they still pay) but they won’t show up when I’m in my room (I know it might be laggy but maybe 1-3 sims won’t be that bad).
All and all is this pack fun? Yes but I won’t recommend you to buy full price.

1707,북적북적 다세대 주택 리뷰,"The game crashes constantly and you get put into endless loading screen loops when you try to select a family to play. Don't buy this, it will break your game.",Not Recommended
1708,북적북적 다세대 주택 리뷰,"Some of the bugs driving the negative reviews for this pack have been patched, and others are supposedly being actively worked on. So setting those aside, this pack is somewhere middling, but generally pretty alright. I recommend this if you are enthusiastic about building multifamily residences, or if you have a lot of other packs. I do not recommend this if you have very few other packs, because everything you do in it for live mode is very passive (go get packs with more active activities first).

The Good:
-Residential Rentals greatly expand your entire world! They effectively give you up to 99 extra residential lots (through splitting lots into multiple residential units), wherever and however you want to allocate them. What you can do with them is endless. While the default unit cap per lot is 6, there is a cheat to unlimit units per lot. At some point performance will suffer, where that is depends on your system. The system to make Residential Rentals is also very intuitive.
-The CAS is really fantastic! Good quality models and textures, in a range of styles, with swatches that are easy to mix & match with this and other packs clothing.
-The build and buy assets are also pretty nice, mostly coming in a good range of swatches, and everything has good looking models.
-Squat toilets have made their first Sims appearance with this pack.
-There is a game option to turn off rental events, which shuts off potentially unwanted events.
-As far as ""explorable"" rabbit holes go, Tomarang's are pretty decent for both story and collections. And there's two of them on the same map.
-Hopscotch is playable by children, teens, and older. It actually has correctly varied animations for the different swatches, which is more attention to detail than expected from Sims 4.
-5 new traits. Sims 4 is terribly trait starved right now (thanks to Growing Together's Self Discovery feature), and 5 is so much more than packs usually give.
-The Mold lot trait is hilarious! I always love a new ghost type!

The Bad:
-Tomarang is small. The lots are small, there are no large lots. Both sections of the map are small. It FEELS small as you visit it. The map might be pretty, but it is hard to appreciate pretty when there's hardly anything to even look at.
-As a landlord, your tenants can and will repeatedly refuse to pay both rent and fines. You simply take a loss when you evict them, as you can no longer attempt to collect. This functionality is obnoxious for gameplay, and so far removed from reality that it's outright absurd.
-Residential Rentals have a few functionality quirks, such as you have to change the lot type to a residential rental before you can place a residential rental from the gallery. (This isn't too bad imo, but it does confuse a LOT of people.) They also need every lot trait to be set individually, with no way to copy traits from the other units or set them all at once.
-While the marbles collection is great, the marbles game can only be played by children. Teens and older should have been able to play marbles too.
-The unit rules for rentals leave basically everything to be desired. While it was implied before release that there would be more cross pack unit rules, the ONLY cross pack unit rule is ""No Pets"" for Cats & Dogs. Which seems to only apply to Cats & Dogs, not horses, chickens, hamsters, etc.
-The Handyperson part time job has weirdly high skill requirements for a part time job. You can choose to work from home, but the tasks generally don't make sense (unless you're a landlord, I guess?). (It also pays peanuts, but all the part time jobs do, so that's fine.)
-Snooping and Secrets are not a feature I was personally very interested in, however as snooping can take a fair bit of effort and secrets only earn a paltry $100, the whole feature feels particularly pointless.

The Ugly:
-If the current bugs don't get fixed, the most annoying one will be that lot names are reverted to their default lot name when converted to a residential rental and all units are named ""# Default Lot Name"" (ex ""1 Bargain Bend""). To fix it, EVERY unit must be individually visited and changed as well as the base lot, and in gameplay it may still be called the default name in event pop ups. The worst bit is that at least part of this may actually be a game limitation, and not a bug, as there have been no comments about it from any of the developers.
-If fixed bugs return (because they sometimes do in other packs), it's really annoying as a tenant when the rent bugs out to ""-1"", which gives you a 4.2 billion rent. This is solved by switching to the landlord and resetting the rent value, which is easy, but disrupts whatever you were doing.
-There's a high potential with this pack to get bogged down by loading screens. They are typically fast, but there's a lot of potential for needing to load between different lots rapidly, and every unit requires a full load screen. It can really get to be a too much.",Recommended

1712,북적북적 다세대 주택 리뷰,"This could be a really fun pack, but the bugs ruin the experience. As it is the pack is very frustrating.
Some of the problems I've encountered: the new achievements are broken, if you fix a problem for a tenant it sometimes doesn't register (like repairing a stove with bits instead of replacing doesn't count and can bring down your rental score...this is one example, but I've had problems with the trash overload problem never ending until i delete my trashcan or the cursed book not showing up), sometimes placing furniture doesn't work..you just have to close the game and go back in, the rental requirements/price structure makes renting really boring because you can provide a nice apartment and net very little per day because you didn't fill it full of clutter/items that add environment score.
Some things I wish they would have included: improving appliances/beds through upgrades should increase the apartment score, shared spaces with nice amenities should count towards the apartment score, being able to end an event like a pet adoption drive so that you don't have to wait it out in order to go into build mode, being able to put the tassels into the storage box...why is the only use for them to go on the wall? I think the rental rates should go up or the per day $50 unit fee should go down.
Things I like: the potential for the pack is great. I like being able to rent out space and meet neighbors. I like the way the leases are setup with guidelines and fines, but i do wish there was information on the lease screen with when rent would be paid and how much.
I don't think I'd recommend this until EA fixes the game and makes it more fun.

Personally I don't think it's worth $40. I would get it on sale if I were you. Unless you just absolutely love building and designing new houses and apartments for rent, then go for it. (I also don't like how you can only rent out 6 units on a lot.) Hope this helps!",Recommended

- within prebuild apartments, i constantly get an event where my stove explodes and the game tells me to call the apartment owner to fix it. But i can't. I called him, i invited him over, i tried to show him the stove with a new interaction the DLCs comes with, but nothing. I'm stuck with the 1.5k $ to pay. Let this happen like 3 times on a freshly created sim and i have no more money.
- to avoid this, i wanted to build my own apartment, just to notice MASSIVE lags when you have more than 2 apartments.
- i ignored the lag, cuz for me it's mainly in buildmode just to find out i can't move into the apartments i just build, cuz they cost like 24.000.000.000 simoleons a day... ?

1758,그로잉 투게더 리뷰,"I purchased this expansion pack exclusively for the cas and family dynamics. I didn't read up on all the additional game play aspects and so it was neat to learn about different parts of the pack as I began to play; it ties in well with every other pack.

Family dynamics are a really cool addition with this pack, and it can be different for each individual parent and child. For example, dad might have a strict family dynamic with his daughter, but a jokester family dynamic with his son.

Milestones is another neat addition, as each age group can hit different milestones just like children experience in real life. A child might experience the ride a bike milestone while a teenager might experience the first kiss milestone. This makes the game more interactive and adds a neat collection to your sims user profile.

One of my favorite things about the pack overall is the added toddler quirks; each toddler gets three unique quirks. This adds a really personalized feel to family play. For example, one of my toddlers hates to be held, and another one of my toddlers hates bedtime. Not all quirks are negative though, some include loving to be up early or loving to sing.",Recommended

- very strong for everyday (family) gameplay: midlife crisis, stayovers and milestones are fun (even though milestones can be kinda bugged, child births not showing up etc, and the infant stuff is a bit too micromanage-y)
- (pack exclusive) infant playmat is useful
- i like kyle

cons:
- cas and b/b neither memorable nor necessary especially if you have dream house decorator
- (pack exclusive) changing table is unnecessary and annoying to use
- splash pads don't have much gameplay
- family dynamics add a moodlet but not much else
- rabbit hole cinema boring and downright pointless with movie hangout stuff
- the world sucks. full of shells that make me sad. even the starter neighborhood meant for family gameplay is too big so that my kid sims are already tired when they arrive at the playground lol

Although the rest of the infant stuffs were pretty useless, kind of somewhat like decorative and a waste of simoleons but still: the contents within are fun, however the family dynamic disappointed me a bit as I wanted to see my child sim and strict parent sim have a somewhat negative relationship but both started off at like friends...

After having the household members talk to the infant, we are able to interact and do other activities. The key word is INTERACT. This is an INTERACT DLC. The goal here is to make your infant grow up to be a loving, caring and smart individual. There are so many interactions and activities, you'll end up spending hours. EA/Maxis also did a great job with the movement AI and graphics with the infants. I also noticed that your toddlers look and move better too.

1803,그로잉 투게더 리뷰,"While I initially anticipated changing this review to a thumbs up, after playing with the expansion longer I overall can not give this expansion a positive recommendation. There is some very good content in this expansion, but it does not outweigh the bad and the ugly. The content in this pack is fairly thin, focusing on superficial aspects, with absolutely no depth to ANY part of the pack. This results in a pack that is dazzling at first, but fails to stand up for long.

So what's good? The new child aspirations are a much needed breath of fresh content for children. They have more interesting (and more useful) reward traits than the base game child aspirations, and are simple enough to be enjoyable on repeat (unlike the old ones). The tree houses and splash pads are also nice, if you have space for them or place them in a community lot. Social Compatibility is good for a quick hint at which Sims are going to have compatible traits, before your Sims get to know them and learn all their traits.

What's bad? Milestones past the Infant life stage leave a lot to be desired, there are very few of them, they don't record much, they're a little arbitrary. There are progressively less milestones for each stage past infant, and the YA/adult/elder stages have so little they are combined in the UI.
Children's Confidence mechanic feels very arbitrary, and feels redundant with the Parenthood character values. At least it rewards a trait earlier than those?
Anything with a pop up is highly randomized, and almost never appropriate. Family Dynamics? Always Strict, especially when trying to have helpful or positive interactions. NPCs ask to move in often, and it's ALWAYS unfitting - From ""Who the hell are you??"" to ""You have your own family and children!"" Self Discovery traits spam you, often randomly, until you have accepted three more traits - This might not be as bad, if the game had at least twice as many traits...
Burnout is a very grating and arbitrary mechanic, that requires mods to disable. Layoffs should never have been put into this game, and only narrowly avoid being in the ugly by having a game option to turn them off. Adults only received negative content in this expansion, and no, it does not ""enhance the drama"". It just adds more obnoxious things for the player to deal with, that are more likely to get in your way and frustrate than ""enhance the story"" - We Sims players usually have MUCH more creative ways to make Sim lives miserable when that's what we want!

The ugly.
Infant milestones are perhaps the biggest selling point of this pack, yet they are very slow, and a horrible grind, making the repeatability of this content very, very unenjoyable. The generally regarded ""best"" parts of infants - where they're at their cutest dancing, crawling, or trying new foods - require an absolute SLOG to reach, and often won't be reached at all if playing on a short or normal lifespan. Even on a long lifespan, the slog will take most of a Sim's time as an infant, and then they are only enjoyed for a couple days before they age up into toddlers. Speaking of, Toddlers are at their WORST with this pack - Quirks for toddlers mostly make their AI behave even worse. Many old bugs have been revivified and reinvigorated. Toddler milestones do not work. While the life stage as a whole remains pointless as the toddler reward traits have been broken since last year with no sign from EA of intent to fix them.
For older Sims, the Midlife Crisis mechanic is poorly designed. EVERY Sim seems to have a Midlife Crisis, no matter how many aspirations they've achieved or how happy they are. There are only 4 varieties of Midlife Crisis, so for something expected for every Sim, the variety is very low. The objectives of the midlife crisis are randomized, and frequently can not be completed, such as a Sim with no job getting an objective to quit their job.

Original Review:
I can not currently recommend this pack as Milestones are currently bugged to get wiped out, after which they are no longer obtainable. Milestones are the ENTIRE point of this expansion, there's extremely little else here without them. See the bug report thread here: When this bug is fixed, I plan on changing this to a positive review. This is a great pack, aside from this CRITICAL issue.",Not Recommended

1805,그로잉 투게더 리뷰,"This expansion pack was released with the infant update and if you are a family-oriented kind of player that wants a more realistic experience, this expansion is for you. Infants in the past were not that hard to handle, they would sleep throughout the night and get hungry fast. However, this expansion added a huge part of realism and difficulty that might be good or bad depending on what you prefer. In this expansion, infants can't just fall asleep, they wake up and cry when their sleep meter isn't full, learn new skills (as milestones in the game) like learning to talk, walk or eat that they didn't know when they just aged into infants, demand care and attention from their parents, etc. So if you want a realistic gameplay that shows you how hard it is to play a parent, definitely get this expansion.

I just went to try to buy it on the EA page, because I was trying to give credit to one of the video creators Lilsimie? (she showed randomly in my youtube recommendations and I figured why not write in her creator code, doesn't hurt me)

There was first ZERO spots to plug in creator codes, so I couldn't do that. Pretty bummed, I was poking around, and finally figured why not get through Steam.

Then I got to the Steam Finalized purchase place, and realized the price was less than buying through EA.

I was confused, especially since Steam quoted my state's tax (Yeah, my state's dumb as bricks and does a tax on VIRTUAL GOODS. It's a p i s s hole. go figure) So I brought back the EA purchase area to compare.

I'm sorry, Are you so F*cking ARROGANT of a company you feel you deserve a whole F*CKING Sales tax of your own? Because you quoted a whole extra dollar higher.

Don't even try to say ""Oh WuLL StEaM dId iT wRoNg AnD wE hAvE tO cOmPly"" Oh Ho The F*ck No, Steam actually QUOTED where the sale's tax was coming from, where as I noticed your CORRUPT company tried skimming by with a vague generalization.

Corrupt m*therf*ckers. Enjoy the bad review and the cut you have to give to Steam now instead of the actual creators (sucks she was screwed out, but again, there was no creator code area).

Sucks because I know from listening from those dev livestreams and videos, the developers actually seriously care about the game and have really done some incredible things these last couple updates. But this company is sh*t, and if they keep playing at tax fraud like this, well, f*ck around and find out as the saying goes.

Edit: Mental Burnout is bugged and keeps swapping how long is left. started with around 16 hours. Used the Violin as creative to work it down. Instead got 19 hours. It was a holiday so had my sim enjoy that. Went to 9 hours. K so morning will fix that now, right? Nope f*ck you 0 minutes then 7 hours back onto the clock -_-",Not Recommended

1822,그로잉 투게더 리뷰,"Get this pack if you like to play with families and creating unique stories. Younger Sims (excluding teens) will find extra content themed around shaping who they are which will impact your game. Adults have new opportunities to cut loose too (mid life crisis and discovering yourself). When it comes to elders, besides the obvious family dynamics and them maybe having more impact as grandparents (can come, stay over, help out) there isn't anything that will make that stage of life any more interesting than it already is (and it really isn't).

1846,캠핑을 떠나요 리뷰,"So, I really wanted a third rating option here of ""Meh"". I guess I'll rate this thumbs down, because *on its own* you do not want this pack. However if you're getting a handful of packs you probably DO want this pack, as some of the things in it are really helpful to doing OTHER packs content. Specifically, if you want to go on vacation in Selvadorada or one of the other neighborhoods (like Sulani), or an expedition with the extreme sports from Snowy Escape, then you will really benefit from having the tents / camping gear out of this pack.

Camping in Granite Falls was a pretty huge let down. There's only one real forest area, and it doesn't really have much to explore in it. The hidden area is not a lot bigger than just the hermit's cabin, and there's only a couple things to do there and basically no reason to ever go back after a Sim's been there the one time. The campground area is the biggest of the three areas by far, and there's not much to it since it's mostly just cabins - Also, there's only one campsite for tents by default.

Herbalism is also basically a complete bust. It does add a lot more things you can grow in your garden, but unless you want a quick way to make your Sims angry these plants do not do much. The herbal recipes take a silly amount of ingredients, all of which you must actually have (no buying like cooking), so it's frankly faster to solve whatever the actual problem was rather than try to use an herbal remedy.
If you have Realm of Magic, then your spellcaster can just duplicate the annoying ingredients, making herbalism less of a complete waste... Except that spellcasters have their own solutions to everything worthwhile that herbalism was trying to do, and spellcasters do it better.",Not Recommended

My biggest issue at the moment is there is a dramatic increase of crashes to my game with this pack. It would happen on a rare occasion before. Now, its really common place. Also, sims tend to ""lock up"". I am not sure what causes this, but they seem to not be doing anything, when they are? It just doesn't visually show, I usually have to save and reload, or save and go to the manage worlds. Sometimes, just opening a pup up window clears this issue. This seems to be a new bug to this pack.

The good parts are, its moderately enjoyable to work with the horses, when they work and get past some visual jank that happens. Defiantly love the build mode stuff, thought I wish there was more clutter and activities. The CAS is alright, still wish there was more stuff.

Most of the negative reviews is over somethings that are fixable easily by the player. If you don't like your horse walking into your house then select all the entrance doors, then ""lock for..."" and the select ""all horses"" or ""everyone but household"" etc. If you prefer a fenced in farm or ranch do the same with the gated doors. If your horse glitches or gets stuck by the feeder then make sure there's 1 tile free on each side and that won't continue to glitch. If there was anything to complain about is I'd wish that the baby horses would look like a mix of both parents, instead it is almost exact copy and paste, even with added animal patterns or stamps. I'd prefer the babies look like both because it's unique and realistic too. Even that is fixable tho in create/cas. Don't let bad reviews ruin the choice of buying this one! Have fun simmers!

1857,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"I wish there was a 'maybe' option because this COULD be a great DLC if it wasn't for the rage-worthy bugs.

When I heard this was coming out I expected Western and English styles but no it's just Western, an English style would be nice but we know that's too much for them to add. Too much content!

The build mode items are nice, it has some of my favourite items, but a lot of the swatches look grimy. There isn't an option for a non-grimy swatch so swatches are restricted if you don't like said grime.

Create-a-sim items are a bit lacklustre, the female hair isn't what I imagined but then again I was expecting the two riding styles not just one so that could just be my expectations getting in the way... Or once again EA cba to make a pack with a lot of content.

Create-a-horse has barely any breeds, you have to make a majority of the breeds up and, unless I haven't found it yet, you can't save the breed you made as a new breed. You have to save it as a separate household and import it when needed.
The tack has only three saddles, two western, one English, and imo only one of the western saddles looks good.
There's a unicorn horn but not a unicorn breed, again you have to make it yourself
The voices sound pretty bad, especially the 'unicorn', there's no option to have a slow muffled grunt or a long whinny/roar.

The world is nice but again only western. It's fairly large and has varying lot sizes with nice scenery but it feels like it's lacking certain elements.

Gameplay can be fun at times such as harvesting wild prairie grass & ageing the nectar found in them, looking after goats instead of infants, competitions (that you can only enter once per day, you can't even watch your sim compete against others), building your own stables... That's it. The rest, such as the long repetitive clicking and waiting that's called ""training"", is buggy and frustrating. A lot of the times my sim ends up T-posing on my horse as it runs in place.

At around half an hour in I either play a different save/household or just not bother with the horses at all.

My horse glitched outside of my property and i was not aware that he was not eating, without warning my horse vanished and the message read ""your horse has been rescued because of your neglect"" and i have zero way of getting it back after this kidnappingggg, so that was the best part. Ranch Hands are 100/hr and do jack squat around the property. Have to tell them everyday to pick up manure and instead of doing just that, they stare blankly into the void and walk away and snuggle the goat. You get THREE things for the ""pets"" sections. Water, Hay feeder, horse bed. Then other horse things are scattered throughout different sections, all of which insanely useless, hideous, and lackluster. The goats are beyond saving they need so much so often they constantly threaten to leave from abuse and is starving, will it ever just take care of itself? or will i be bottle feeding forever? Sure feels like it. Also, whats the point of crying abuse if i can just ""collect"" the goats, replace them down on the ground and they are ""full, very happy, clean""? I just sold them since they wanted to keep ""running away"". Horse breeding & customization is bland compared to sims 3, they dont use genetics to breed just spit out a copy of mom or dad.

All in all it´s an okay expansion pack but definitly not worth the money.

Adition:
This expanion pack was interesting for me since I am a horse owner ,however I feel that it solidifies the problem in which some people view horses for only their capability of being riden. There is so much more one could do with a horse and it is truely sad that there´s not even an option to go on a walk with ypur horse without riding it.

I soon learned that I can choose to have a family or be a horse breeder, not both, as there isn't enough room in the household.

1878,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"I did not expect to like this pack, and was completely surprised at how well it turned out! While I definitely recommend this pack, you will get the most out of it if you have the Cottage Living expansion. So I recommend also getting Cottage Living with this pack.

Good:
- The horses look absolutely fantastic. The models are great, the animations are spot on. They have the full paint CAS like Cats & Dogs, so you can make some absolutely stunning horses.
- Horse skills play and feel pretty good. The horses can be passively trained by telling them to interact with the related skill objects, rather than requiring constant Sim attention.
- Horse Breeding is well done and worthwhile! The breeding traits are super useful. Also, if you did a custom paint for the parent horse, it will be simply copied to the foal (50/50 chance for which parent it copies from), so no wasted painting effort.
- Horse competitions are a lot of fun, and there are a decent number of different categories to progress through. However, the profit from competitions when the horse is maxed out is lower than most level 10 careers with no additional bonuses - Your Sims will not get rich from horses.
- The Nectar skill is insanely profitable, with decent versatility for fruit use. I don't have much more to say about it, but nectar is my favorite part of this pack.
- The mini sheep and goats are adorable. They are also a straight copy of functionality from Cottage Living, but not attached to an item - So they get all the benefits from Cottage Living's Animal Enthusiast trait. If you have Cottage Living, they also produce wool / milk, for a LOT less effort and space than llamas and cows, thus they are a complete upgrade functionally to those.
- The CAS is pretty well made, and features a lot of dirty swatches. Much of it isn't my personal style, but the model quality and swatches do not disappoint (except for the oddly flat pair of boots).
- The build and buy items also feature a lot of dirty swatches, which are invaluable for building. The buy items have a huge range of wood colors, and very classic styles; This pack's buy items quickly became some of my most used pieces.

Bad:
- There are not enough swatches or item variety for horse ""clothing"", and particularly saddle blankets. There is not yet, nor do I expect there to ever be, much CC to address this - Cats & Dogs have extremely sparse CC for additional clothing and collars, it is unlikely horses will fare better.
- There are no unicorns. It's just a horn you can put on in CAS that sparkles. No extra abilities.
- When you sell a horse, it is simply deleted. I can't make use of the horse selling feature, because it's too sad for them to be deleted. Selling horses would have been a lot better if they were rehomed to a random NPC instead. For those who are able to put a lot of effort into a horse then delete it for cold hard simoleons, the max sell value for a horse is only ~$52k, and takes a minimum 3 weeks of high effort to reach. - Your Sims will NOT get rich selling horses.
- The only Nectar Maker is a silly stomping bucket. Wine is only made via stomping for novelty and tourists, so I would have preferred a functional ""Nectar Press"" for an alternate interactive object. There is a non-interactive Nectar Press decorative item, so...
- Chestnut Ridge has absurdly, heinously uselessly small lots. While the maps are appropriately large, with plenty of space to go for a ride, and has great off-lot horse features, horses still simply fit better on larger lots. Especially when you want to combine them with ANY other features - such as gardening (for your nectar) or other animals, which play well with horses but are also lot space hogs. For a world map so focused on horses, most of the lots are completely useless for horses / ranches, and very difficult to fit anything else into because of the style of the world. It's a very good looking world, but it feels like it really only has 4 lots, since the other 9 are just plain too small for the content and setting.",Recommended

And then my Sim randomly wake up in the middle of the night just to listen to the horse at 2am... it's very confusing, beautiful horses but so glitchy, it's just not worth the money especially for what it is! Wait for an update",Not Recommended
1886,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"Well if you can't have cars, I guess horses are a good compromise.
Within the sims, there's so many different hobbies, jobs, tasks, daily living, social interactions, and so forth, I often forget half of what I can do, as I have all the large expansion packs installed, and a majority of the packs like the werewolves, vampires etc.
The ranch expansion adds another wormhole of stuff for your sim to do, that I often forget I can send them to become a wizard, werewolf, vampire, and so forth.
I can't complain about having to many options or things to do, and the non-theme related UI, management and function updates that came with are a welcome change.
The Sims4 is a game I think anyone can enjoy, and like Star Wars films (Ahsoka and the Mandalorian series has been awesome!), you might have a vocal minority complain about some aspects of the game, at the end of the day, it's still a good game.
I'd like to see some more lore in an expansion pack, some more depth to specific families.
I'd like to see some more stories, like the strange world expansion with the alien plants, as well as some expansion on aliens in general (as much as aliens have been in the news lately, the fact they went equestrian was a surprise), because as much as I like the create your own story, all these expansions have a RPG Maker-style feel to them, in the sense. ""Here's the game engine, some two dimensional characters, and the ability to build your world, game, and play style!"" That's great, but the alien expansion has been the only expansion I felt gave me a story, a conflict, and a semi multiple ending resolution. Sometimes I'm lazy and just want the game to tell me a good story versus the God-like creator planning, setting up, and creating a story that's probably gonna feel as well written as a fanfic, versus a professionally written novel by a top tier writer.
The ranch expansion is exactly what it sounds like, you're going to get another loading screen gated world, it'll be a pretty world, but they're all pretty. You're going to be able to have horses after you get through the loading screen, but if your sim, for example is a mermaid, their uniqueness is not really going to be able to be displayed in the new areas, outside the sim address you modified yourself.
There's no real connectivity, or continuity, between the expansion worlds.
So if you're an equestrian sort, this is a must have, if you've given up on your hunger for cars, this is an alright TV dinner, and the set pieces are well done, but the Ranch is, like the other expansions, its own isolated world builder play, that isn't going to feed anyone's desire for lore, a story with plot or conflict, or replayable A-B resolution gameplay.
I recommend this expansion, but if you're new to Sims/Sims4, I hope this helps you choose what expansions to add to your game.",Recommended
1887,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"I adore this pack, the horses are created brilliantly. The nectar (wine) making is a great money maker. I would recommend this for anyone who loves horses, mini sheep and mini goats! Its a wonderful addition to a smallholding farm or for those who want to take part in riding competitions!",Recommended
1888,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"As an equestrian when I heard about horses I was really exited about the pack. Overall I think it is a very nice pack. It would be cool if EA combined the horse ranch and the cats and dogs pack into one like they did in the sims 3. The pack definetly could use more gamplay like being able to build jumping courses, be able to go into competitions with your sim and It could use an english style ridding fetures. I would definetly recomened grabbing this pack on a sale if possible, as on its normall price of 40 dollars it is quite overprised. Overall I give this pack a 6/10.",Recommended

You will still have fun with this DLC though.",Recommended

1891,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"Not going to lie, I love this expansion. It's actually hands down my favorite. As an actual horse person, I was stoked when they announced this expansion. Yes, it definitely has some bugs, but considerably less than previous packs/expansions (some of which still don't work right), and they seem to be relatively minimal impact-wise when it comes to gameplay. That said, there is a lot more to like with the expansion than there is to hate on it, in my opinion.

Positives:
- lot more things to do for your sims and just a boost to overall gameplay
- the build items, while not as robust as other expansions/packs, are lovely, actually seem to match colors across the items, and versatile enough to fit in with any type of build, not just rustic ranches
- the new world is stunning and has lots of little bonus features to it
- the horses are fun to play with, utterly adorable, and more realistic than those from Sims 3 - you can tell a lot more research, thought, and care went into creating them
- the CAS items are great - nice new outfits and fun, useful traits, as well as the paint tool for the horses, which makes it more fun to create perfect digital copies of any equines from your real life
- the compatibility with the ranch items to previous expansions, especially the cottage living items/animals, adds an extra layer of enjoyment and certain level of realism to a Sim's ranch life
- the mini goats and mini sheep are so cute it almost hurts

Negatives:
- despite a couple of patches, there are still things glitching out that are specific to this expansion; for example, my sim will just freeze/lag often enough to be noticeable and annoying. Even with a reset, they'll still lag or remain frozen a bit longer before finally doing what they were told to do.
- a lot of positional errors occur - while some are amusing, it seems sloppy to have this issue on so many things, especially when asking $40 for the expansion. For example, Sims' arms will go backwards, be sideways, or in some other crazy position when doing things like feeding the mini goats or mini sheep, doing certain things with the horses, or interacting with other animals. It usually doesn't stop the interaction and can be funny at times, but shouldn't even be a thing for a released expansion.
- could have had more build and CAS items

Overall, and despite the glitches and bugs, I find this expansion is a lot of fun to play and adds a lot to the game in a really positive way. May be worth waiting to buy it when it's on sale if you're still unsure if it's worth getting or not though.",Recommended
1892,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"So far the bugs I've had are that the horses keep coming into my house, blocking pathways and sometimes the sim will just lag and stand there even if they've got stuff to do :) This doesn't happen often though.

1898,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"I want to be happy with this soo soo bad but... regrettably, one of the main things I was excited about is completely and udderly disappointing: breeding. The ""mixed"" review is soo accurate. As many things as I like and even love in this pack, this one thing alone makes it hard to enjoy (don't get me started on the lack of patterns and CAS swatch customization options, or the dreadfully abysmal paint + erase tool that only works on a single layer the game chooses for you).

There is no point breeding the horses for looks anymore. Did you spend hours creating two custom original looking parents hoping to breed them and see what amazing combination of patterns and colours they might create (like they did in the Sims 3) only for the foal to turn out to be a carbon copy of a singular parent with a different mane and tail colour? I find myself having to cheat full CAS access just to spend another 15+ minutes editing the foal to pretend it looks related to both parents instead of a DNA clone of only one of them. This was probably the one thing I was looking forward to the most and as cute as the foals are, it doesn't make up for the feeling of grand disappointment every time a foal is born and looks like the horse you're tired of staring at.

If you're a horse lover like me, who is just desperate for more video game content of horse gameplay, this might scratch your itch.
If you're a long-time Simmer and a horse lover who obsessively spent literal days of their life playing with horses on the Sims 3, creating an incredible legacy with beautifully blended offspring each generation, and were hoping you'd get at least a smidgen of that satisfaction from breeding your champions or eye catchers, well, go back to TS3 because you're not going to get that here.

All in all I'm saying Yes for everything that is not genetics and CAS related, but it's honestly painful to do so.",Recommended
1899,즐거운 목장 리뷰,so i bought this expansion pack because i was excited about there being some more animals. i loaded the gaame up and checked on some other saves that i have and they were working just fine. i started a whole new game for the horses expansion and got my house all changed up and nice looking and got a horse and went to take care of my sims needs and she wont go into the house no matter what i do. im seeing now that theres bugs and im seeing that there was an update release to fix bugs. did bugs get fixed and new ones added? i spent full price for this game and i cant even do the basic necessity of the game. is anyone else still having issues or figured out how to fix this?? this is ridiculous. i hope ea and steam can give something back for the issues everyone is having :( prep for any possible issues this pack may have,Not Recommended

Only downside is an annoying bug I've encountered, where my sims will not eat or cook anything...so hopefully that gets fixed sooner rather than later!",Recommended
1909,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"I 100% recommend this buggy mess of a DLC. If you love encountering bugs within every minute, this is for you. Want your sims to be deleted? Buy this extremely overpriced and under-tested pack today for a whopping $40 which is the price of an entire game that contains more than just a horse DLC! Here, you can experience the wonderful life of frustration and disappointment in EA as you try to enjoy yourself. With this one-of-a-kind experience, you can encounter their lack of thorough development shining through every action you take. Thought you were having fun? HAH! They will throw a corrupted file in your face just to ruin your day. They like to keep things spicey here at EA, as this is a no-fun-full-bug zone! So take this opportunity to be ripped off out of $40 and have an unplayable experience.



List of bugs i've encountered so far:

1) I started the game and all my save files were deleted
2) The moment I went to make a new household after it deleted all my previous ones, I couldn't name my sims
3) Once playing in the game, within the first few minutes one of my horses glitched when turning
4) Every time I go to have my sim eat or make something - she is unable to eat or cook as food is completely bugged. This means I have to go back to the main menu every time she eats. So far this happens every single time she eats - which has been over 20 times now.
5) I went to the equestrian center for a competition and my sim didn't follow. My horse ended up stuck inside of the center and nearly died due to being trapped inside of the equestrian center. I had to travel to another location to get my horse unstuck since resetting the equestrian center did nothing. EDIT: I keep encountering this bug so it is clear that it is a common bug. This should have been fixed before release.
6) I keep having to re-assign my horses to a bed as it seems to reset every time I leave the lot
7) I can't assign any tasks to my sim that has to do with interacting with my horse if she is eating food, otherwise she will just leave her food behind and not even eat just to interact with the horse instead. It would be nice if she would eat first then go do her chores, but seems to be the other way around here.
8) Even though I have autonomy off, my sim still is acting on her own will when it comes to dismounting the horse. I would like if she doesn't dismount the moment she has no actions.
9) Autonomy is completely bugged. Doesn't matter if you have it on or off, your sim just does what they want regardless.
10) Asking your horse to train on it's own is bugged. They will do it for like 1 second if they do it at all. May as well not even try to get them to train.
11) Locking gates and doors for pets don't work. My horses are literally walking through my front door right now and it's ""locked"". Not even a double-sized door at that, but a small door. My house is not big enough for two gigantic horses to be walking through my tiny front door.
12) Every time my sim is eating and my horse tries to interact with her, she stops eating and starts interacting with the horse. As you can tell, this becomes an issue when I have horses invading my sim's living room every few seconds trying to get her attention - and oh wait, I can't lock the door. Great.
13) Do I even need to mention that Ranch Hands are broken too? While it is a great idea and very much needed, it's poorly executed considering my Ranch Hand gets paid to do nothing. Sometimes she decides to help, but like all things at this point, she too, has received the bug disease.
14) My sim went to harvest milk from her goat and one of her arms decided to detach itself and form a two-layered arm. Her left arm went through her torso and merged itself with her right arm. This is seemingly a horror DLC.
15) I tried to move furniture in my house and it kept telling me that there was something intersecting it and that I couldn't move the objects. I literally have done nothing to this house and it's a house that comes with this pack.
16) Calling horses is bugged after attending an equestrian center competition. They won't come and will just stand there and slowly die.
17) Now competitions are not working. Tried to have my sim go home and she ran half way, then teleported back to the equestrian center where she proceeded to stay trapped where my horse was standing, then she miraculously teleported herself (with none of my input) back to where she was before.
18) My sim just ate her salad on her computer's keyboard
19) Basically everything they added is bugged, so why did they release this when clearly it needed more time to be developed?

Things I don't like:

1) You have to socialize with your horse morning and night otherwise their social need will drop dramatically. They are incredibly high maintenance this way if you want your sim to be able to do other things besides spend their whole day on a horse. If you only interact with them once a day, their social need will be so low that it becomes a problem.

2) Breeding horses only clones one of the parents - with slight variations like hair color. Their coat will be the same as one of the parents. I personally wanted to be able to breed unique foals that are mixes of the parents, not clones. Clearly they put this pack together for some quick money and didn't even put the effort into making it well.

3) Goats and sheep needs decay way too quickly. Literally within 1 day of getting a sheep and goat, they were filthy and ready to be cleaned. There is no reasonable way to upkeep a farm when each animal requires constant attention from your sim, let alone do anything else with your sim to begin with. Needs like socialization and needing to be cleaned should decay much slower in order to give you time to do something else other than tend to pets all day long every single day. It gets very tiring and your sim can't have much of a life. This was an issue with cottage living as well. Again, this is unreasonable. It actually gets stressful considering how quickly your pets turn from ""excellent"" to ""poor"" in a matter of half a sims day. Please make it so social needs take a few days to get to poor, and cleaning only needs to be done like once every other week. Because this is too much maintenance to the point that it's not fun, it's just a chore and a pain. I want to be able to have goats and sheep, but now i'm sick and tired of constantly entertaining them all sims day long.

4) This DLC seems like it would be very fun, and when i'm not being bombarded with bugs constantly, I'm enjoying it. However, every few minutes I have to exit to the main menu or do something besides play in order to fix a bug. Please for crying out loud - don't release broken packs. It is not fair to your playerbase to charge $40 for a DLC and then have it not even be in reasonable condition.

5) I'm sick and tired of dealing with bugs every few minutes. It is frustrating.

6) $40 for a horse DLC that just took the sims 3 horse model and changed some animations

7) The whole pack lacks creativity and effort. They didn't care about the experience of the player. It's a rip off.

8) Goats/Sheep should be full sized and able to have babies.

Things I like:

1) The horses are fun to ride and train. I'm enjoying having them on my farm.
2) I like the aspect that they graze and feed themselves, makes it less work for my sim.
3) I like that you can enter each horse in a competition every day. This means if you have 5 horses, you can enter 5 times. If you have 1 horse, you can only enter 1 time. This gives the incentive to have a horse farm where competing is the specialty.
4) I like that the horses interact with each other. It is cute to see them becoming friends. I also like the fact that you can design your own stables.
5) I like that if you want to adopt a horse, it costs simoleons rather than being free.
6) I just saw my horse pee
7) The building objects are very nice and lovely. I hope more of these will be made in the future.",Not Recommended
1910,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"I was waiting this pack for a really long time! In general feelings are mixed, and let me explain why. Let's start from the positive moments:

+ Beautiful and pretty big world. Some of the locations are breathtaking.
+ Nice furniture and its design, just love this Ranch staff, colors and atmosphere in general.
+ HORSES and their behaviors! + extra small animals (MY LOVE). Just adorable! No negativity here.
+ New moods and new extra human behavior. It seems pretty real.

And here are negative moments:
- I was confused why the game was released with so many bugs. I was thinking that I shouldn't buy it but I was waiting it for so long, that is why my desire was stronger then logic lol;
- When I opened the game first time, I was very confused, when in the Sims creation window, in the ""Face Section"" there was no option on choosing human faces. Like, WHAAA?;
- Sometimes during game my Sim was disappearing, after reloading a game, everything were coming back to normal;
- Not many of new things in the pack. Like c-mon, you take almost 50$ for a game! That's so few for such amount of money;
- Big amount of negative comments at the day of the release (which says a lot, actually).

CONCLUSION:
Just because I am a HUGE fan of horses and animals and cottage life in general, I was super happy. But this thing with bugs and especially with small amount of items upsets me a lot. The thing with items happen with all the packs. I can understand such amount for a tiny pack, but not for a whole big extra pack. I love Sims 4 with all my heart, but at the same time I feel from time to time that I'm being robbed. I DO recommend this game to animal and cottage life lovers, but don't exaggerate your expectations about it.",Recommended

I do not like this. I think instead of money, you should get milk and choose what you want to do with it (make cheese, drink it, etc.). #2, is the foals. I absolutely dislike the fact that the foals are an exact copy of one of their parents. I really hope this changes, because for me, it takes the fun out of breeding new foals.

1926,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"So, the pack is beautiful. I love the horse breeds, I love the western style, I've always wanted to live this life and now i can through sims. It is a great pack so far, I really enjoy the multiple aspects of the pack like barrel racing, dressage, etc.

Now that being said, when I first played the game, I was very disappointed because it wasn't working. No chat bubbles, no interactions would work, a lot of the items were bugged. I spent a fortune on sheep and goats for my farm after getting a foal to start with they never arrived, I wanted to mingle it in with my 5th gen sims and start a story line for a baby girl.

SO I disabled my mods, some of my sims were bald and or unclothed but i switched it in manage world. Still wouldn't work. I cleared caches, I spent a lot of time looking through files. And then it hit me, i'm doing all of this to save my sim game when I can just save my household and load up a new world and smack em in from the library. This seemed to fix all of my problems. I tested it out and everything fixed itself. I imported the previous gens from library, and I started on this new world. Now I know this would be a diff story for a lot of people as they would want to keep their world and households. Now the packs working great, kinda worth my sacrifice tbh.

NOW ALL OF THIS BEING SAID. The pack was just released, you never know whats going on within the devs worlds, whether someone wanted to release this too early, or if something happened between their testing platform switching to the official sims platform. Don't be aholes because this pack isn't working right off the bat, this pack offers a lot of new mechanics, a lot of new animations which take tons of time to make, a ton of horse breeds and coats, people clearly took a lot of time into this pack and they never completely planned to release it either. Its disappointing to see that something you're excited for and paid good money for might not work just yet, i get it. Don't immediately jump the gun and put bad reviews on it though. When the pack started working I was absolutely fascinated with everything it had to offer. Not saying let it slide, im putting out there that when problem packs like this happen, the devs usually hop right onto to it w bug fixes etc. I hope this helps you guys with the new world and please upvote so i can possibly help more people enjoy this beautiful pack <33",Recommended

When the DLC released, bubbles and interactions were broken and non-existent. EA quickly patched the bubbles and some interactions, but there are still many broken interactions.

1938,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"All glitches have been fixed or at least for me. I restarted my PC after downloading before entering the game but I don't know if that helped. Overall I personally love the pack but am also a big animal lover. I wouldn't rate this above Cottage Living or Seasons but it is definitely a mid-tier pack. The world is pretty and I like the CAS + build mode items. Horses are cute with fun animations as well. However there aren't a lot of large lots, no new death types, careers, or WooHoo locations and the racing system is a rabbit hole which personally doesn't bother me but might bother some. Also no unicorns (save for a glittering accessory).
Personally unless someone else is spending their money on it for you as a gift I would wait until a sale comes out. Not worth, in my mind, $39.99. Overall a lot of fun, the amount of joy I get from watching my horse play with a giant ball is unreasonable. I rate this pack a 8/10.",Recommended

I managed to fix the issue with the pack by opening the game from the play now button from the pack's store page. This has fixed the other issues discussed, except for the naked sim one.

1960,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"It is very apparent that The Sims 4 has come a long with the graphics and treatment of world's. YES maps are smaller but they are much higher quality as far as aesthetics are concerned. The main selling point for any newer dlc is the quality of build and buy items. Personally I mostly build on the game and appreciate how new windows and doors have such a higher quality look to them almost as though the resolution is ""redone"". The buy mode is a bit limited for what is an expansion pack but a lot of the free update and build mode items are amazing. The fences and gates are also a very nice addition. I wish there were more trees and some new roofing styles.

Gameplay? - meh it's horses after cottage living and pets whats the point? I'm sure I'll love the horses but the strength of this dlc is the aesthetic of the world and possibilities for building. It's sims 4 don't expect a lot for your money. It's basically a game pack lol.

If you're wondering about this DLC here's the lowdown so far.

I will state I have not tried to do the wine half of the ranch DLC as of yet.
(Edit 1 as the issues in my bugs section have been patched.)



- You train your horses with the few items your horse can practice with to raise your stats for the horse competition.

- The competitions themselves do not display, It's like how your sims 'go to work' and it automatically places your horse and gives you a plaque to state your rank.

- You cannot create your own sheep / goat it's made for you to 'Rescue' via the new community board and as of yet I have not seen any customisation options for them.

- If you lock the gate to the fenced area your horses live in to stop it walking into your house, once you take part into a competition, It cannot walk back inside meaning if you want to keep it inside the fenced area on your lot you're constantly tasked with the unlock re lock options.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs:

Before even loading into the DLC gameplay itself the traits for sims and horses have no text. What I mean by this is the image for the trait is displayed as it should be however it does not show what the trait name is or what it does. I also noticed the breed names for the horses are blank.

After loading into the game itself I noticed three other bugs.

- Lot names in the new area are not named correctly. They all say something along the lines of ""Template"".

- In the building menu many of the new items say **Debug**

-Horse interactions are blank, meaning you don't know what you're clicking.

I'm sure we will see patches to these issues very soon so that we can enjoy our time on this DLC.",Recommended

But besides that, When I got into the game the text bubbles are blank and the items are called DEBUG items. I'm going to give EA a break cause obviously they love this DLC and I do too. And not to mention it just came out. So obviously there is gonna be some bugs and glitches I wasnt expecting everything to be perfect. Also the new traits for the horses and the sims are broken. But again it just came out not everything is going to be perfect. I see people complaining about it that they spent 40$ for it just to be broken and EA just wants the money. You gotta understand that it literally came out...an hour and 25 minutes ago. I get your unhappy, but they'll end up fixing it and then you'll get your moneys worth. Just have to be patient. But besides that. I spent an hour in cas and then moved onto game play. So far I love the items and I love how many options they have for male sims in cas. Which they normally dont do. As a horse loving girl my whole life..I love the western theme. I get what EA is trying to go for. Either way, after they fix the chat bubbles being blank, I think it'll be a okay DLC.


And now they have fixed the bubble mistake! And I come back a few hours later after getting off of work, and the DLC has negative reviews just because of a minor mistake. I think people should just be patient with EA and at least give the pack a try before making a negative review.
Thanks EA!

Okaayyy..My second time editing this review. Mostly cause I wanna give a honest review on how I think the game is so far. I played about..3 hours of the DLC. In those 3 hours I..got my sim married, him and his wife both have horses and are learning how to ride, he is level 2 of wine making and I got a bunch of mini goats and sheep cause why not. I spent alot of that time building a barn for the horses and the sheep and goats. But I like it so far. I havent explored the world yet cause I wanted them to do it on horse back, but I'm excited for that. Oh and my sims father died..Which was sad but I made them get married anyway. Even though after they got married they started crying in eachothers faces....But its fineee. The side jobs you can do are a nice way of earning extra money, which I 100% needed cause even after giving my sim 45000$ to start his new life (dont worry his parents were loaded I made sure) It went by fassttt. Who knew building a barn could be so expensive. But I like how you can make your own stable basically with whatever you want just as long as you have a horse bed. And I think its cool how your wine can age and I think its interesting how if its in a basement is ages faster. But either way, If you like horses and like a rags to riches kind of feel or not..thats okay to, this DLC is nice.",Recommended

2020,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"Oh boy.. You did it again EA, and I fell for your scam, hook line and sinker. Fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice, shame on you! I hope you get a patch out ASAP because a bunch of us are having the issue of missing text from interaction boxes. And I even had missing text from CAS on horse traits AND other things! That's new, from what I'm seeing in reviews right now. :D Good job EA.
Edit #1: Oh boy. I'll keep updating this every time I find a new bug. A lot of horse related build mode items seem to be labeled ** DEBUG **. For those of you who aren't familiar with this name, **DEBUG ** is usually the name on items which you have to use a cheat to even see them in build mode in the first place.
Edit #2: Like the other reviews said, the interactions with horses themselves are broken and missing text too. So I can't really make friends with my horse very well if I can't tell what I'm trying to do with it, can I? So much for your idealistic approach to horse rider relationships, EA. Even horse related notifications are blank, AND a couple of Sims originating from the expansion's world had no names.
Edit #3: OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. Even adopting mini goats/sheep gives you the ** DEBUG ** text from their adoption menu.

Edit #4: A patch was finally released fixing the issue. I will be keeping the rest of this review up to serve as a reminder of EA's mistakes so they might do better in the future..
Anyhoo. Unsurprising to anyone who payed attention to the lackluster promotional content, this ""expansion"" is.. more like a game pack. Sure, it had quite a few new things it adds, but it isn't really worth the $40 price tag, unfortunately. Be smarter than me, and get it on sale if you're still interested.",Not Recommended

2022,즐거운 목장 리뷰,"Edit 21.07.23: They fixed the bug with the missing text. So now you can actually read what you're doing with your horse. Which means, I can now tell you, that I really like the horses and how you can interact with them I build a baby horse and adopted another in the town and they do interact with each other. You can teach them to eat grass and feed them with a bottle. The horses roam around the ranch and get spooked every other hour, which is sort of funny (because real horses are nearly as idiotic as the Sims-horses), but gets a little bit annoying, because you have to stop what youre doing to un-spook the babies. But you are rewarded with really good looking, cute horses and other animals, realistic movement and good social interaction.
I don't know yet how the riding looks, because... baby-horses.

Contra: The horses can't come into my bed. Those poor babies have to sleep outside and get frightened by trees. And then they walk around with hanging head looking all sad and I can't finish my beauty sleep because I need to save them...


20.07.23 First of all, I made a horse. And its actually really cute and it moves fine. But as a lot of others already said, theres still the bug, that you cant read any bubbles related to the DLC.

2034,Jungle_Adventure 리뷰,I went back to Sims 3 World Adventures. It knocks this out of the water. I really hope Sims 4 creates something like that but they probably won't. The Archaeology skill is kinda fun and if you mod it in order to live in Selvadorada and mod to get a career as an archaeologist. Or pair it with the Get Famous DLC to become a famous archaeologist it's kinda fun. But there's no real exploration like there was in Sims 3 which I was really looking forward to. Probably a rushed DLC by EA.,Recommended
2035,Jungle_Adventure 리뷰,"If you're like me and you looked at this DLC hoping it's the literal or spiritual successor to Sims 3: World Adventures, then you're going to be just as terribly disappointed as I was. Jungle Adventures doesn't even have half the content and isn't half as fun. It relies on a handful of gimmicks that get old after a while, with no real reason to make a trip to it's singular neighborhood. It adds some neat things for CAS and Build Mode but the entire selling point--going on an exotic adventure--just doesn't exist. The setting is beautiful and interesting, but there's nothing there to really keep your interest for long. Think of it as a stuff pack with a bonus location - that's basically what it is.

There aren't many tombs and most of the time you're just being harassed by bees while clearing vines with your bare hands because the vendors won't sell you a machete because their inventory rotates at random for some unknown reason. You'll end the trip with less than half as many relics as a single tomb from World Adventures would net you, and they aren't worth nearly as much in simoleons. Traps are boring and easy to dismantle, complexes are straightforward with no real exploration required, entire parts of the maps are sealed off for no real reason at all because much like the merchant inventories their availability 'rotates'.

World Adventures was easily my favorite Sims 3 DLC, and I was hoping Jungle Adventure would likewise be my favorite Sims 4 DLC. I remain disappointed. Not enough to refund it as I do like a lot of the Mesoamerican, Latin, and adventure stuff for CAS and Build Mode you get from it, but enough to discourage others from wasting their time with this disappointing entry and it's lacking content. This is without question an enormous step down from World Adventures.",Not Recommended
2036,Jungle_Adventure 리뷰,"I get that some people love Star Wars and maybe the world is not as big as I would like it to be, but I personally think this gamepack is much better and more impressive than Journey To Batuu especially since contrary to Batuu you do not get spam requests to come here. Not only is it profitable to visit this location where you could make a lot of simoleons, but also fun as well after attempting to vacation here for myself. Especially for people who have never visited here before and did not watch any youtube videos previously as spoilers before visiting this location. Also, if you explore an entire temple you make a lot of simoleons in addition to me really liking the CaS and building items as well.",Recommended
2037,Jungle_Adventure 리뷰,"Recommended if you :
-Love jungle themes
-Love adventure
-Love riddles & puzzle
-Love collecting artifacts
-Love new clothes, hair, and home stuffs

The vacation is relatively more costly than other vacation (like Granite Falls & else), but your sims would suddenly be rich after did some adventure, collecting and selling the artifacts!",Recommended
2038,Jungle_Adventure 리뷰,"The world this pack comes with is very nice, the build buy is also nice as well as cas and the gameplay is really cool to me, however you should buy every sim pack while its on sale",Recommended
2039,Jungle_Adventure 리뷰,"I loved this pack, definitely one of my favourites. It is so much better than Outdoor Retreat for a vacation world. Visually, it is beautiful and game play-wise, it actually rewards you for your Sim's skills; high gardening skill allows you to go through the jungle gateways without the need for a machete (a negative aspect of the game is getting supplies from the marketplace - very hit and miss as not everything is available at any one time). High fitness skill increases your chance of success with the chance cards. Having the herbalism skill (Outdoor Retreat required) and making a supply of insect repellent means you don't have to worry about buying certain supplies from the marketplace. Improving the archaeology skill (introduced in this pack) makes the temple section easier. I would also recommend a vacation of 3 nights and, if you have Outdoor Retreat, getting a tent and cooler to keep in your Sim's inventory, as it can take a bit of time to explore, especially if you want to do excavations. I also advise purchasing the 'waterproof' reward trait for your Sim, as given the setting, it of course rains a lot.

You will need to return to Selvadorada more than once if you wish to fully explore the world, as not all parts are accessible in any single visit, and to make the most of the new skills in archaeology and Selvadorian culture (incidentally, both of these skills are available as elective classes, if you have the University EP). For the gardeners, there are new harvestables to collect and grow yourself.

The puzzle solving element once you reach the temple is fun (although takes some time) and as the temple resets each visit, it's never quite the same experience twice. The treasure found at the end is worth a large amount of Simoleons, as are some of the artefacts you can excavate, and although archaeology is unfortunately not a new career or degree (though there are new aspirations linked to it), you can build the skill up enough to easily make a living as a self-employed expert.

The build items are lovely and include new floor and wall tile patterns, and new indoor and outdoor plants.

Overall, if you are looking for something for your adventurous and outdoorsy Sims, and love a bit of immersion and problem solving and are not after instant gratification, this is a fun pack to get.",Recommended
2040,Jungle_Adventure 리뷰,"While I don't personally use the gameplay or the world, the real reason to buy this pack is for the furniture.

2041,Jungle_Adventure 리뷰,"I only got this pack despite the mostly negative reviews because of the nostalgia of adventure worlds on The Sims 3. It may not be as fun or exciting as the Sims 3 adventure worlds and it is most certainly not one of the first packs I would recommend getting, but if you really love playing The Sims 4 like I do then I would recommend this pack. If this pack is less buggy than other packs then I do not really understand why the reviews are mostly negative.",Recommended

2043,Jungle_Adventure 리뷰,The Sims series is an amazing game series that has a very talented/passionate development team.

For me that pack is 5/5 but i bought it mostly for build buy so i give it a 3 for a review based on game play.",Not Recommended
2049,Jungle_Adventure 리뷰,"This pack is the nice surprise. The build and buy items are really versatile. You’ll be in happy with you purchase if you enjoy landscaping or decorating your house with greenery.

The jungle is like a semi-open world, which is a feature I enjoy. I often get lost in it. Many fishing spots. Great views if you have a painter sim. New archeology skill. A stunning map.

As for the gameplay itself with the temples and all... it’s not something you’ll finish in one or two sittings (unlike Realm of Magics). It takes multiple trips and preparation to unlock places, gear up, get the « salvadoradan » knowledge needed. It’s quite entertaining. If you got this pack, you’ll reuse it quite a few times.

I recommend you watch a few videos detailing the BB items and the gameplay before deciding if this is worth €20 (or €15 when it’s on sale).",Recommended
2050,Jungle_Adventure 리뷰,"The archaeology is pretty fun, some of it feels a bit ""Oregon Trail-y""/Monkey Island-y (i love these games more than my right little finger). None of the build items are useful outside of Selvadorada, but there are a lot - and in this case it just makes it feel newer and immersive/3D. It feels less cobbled together as some of the others can be and I'd say this one is worth getting. And please don't give me the baby finger/Monkey Island ultimatum, I think I probably need that finger.",Recommended
2051,Jungle_Adventure 리뷰,"So, compared to other game packs, this is probably going to be one want to consider picking up after you have a few others. Unless you're really into the Indiana Jones vacation (with less giant boulder scenes), I wouldn't really recommend this before packs like Realm of Magic, Vampires, or Spa Day. If you're looking for a vacation that'll REALLY get your Sims out of their normal routine though? Then this is absolutely the pack you want, and Selvadorada is absolutely beautiful.

Going on a vacation to Selvadorada is an impressively robust adventure experience - Sims style. You will want your Sims to either pay attention to that advice to stock up very well before they set out, or else be extremely skilled (in many skills - not just archaeology!), otherwise they CAN actually fail to make it all the way through the jungle on a vacation. There is replayability, with a single vacation being locked to only so much.

Back home, you can raise your archaeology skill before you set out, and you will be mailed artifacts when you have a high skill so it stays useful in normal play. The culture skill has a ton of social interactions that you can take home for extra flavor. The Build/Buy items have a lot of really upscale and exotic additions that can make your home look pretty unique (or just expensive).

Compared to Sims 2's Bon Voyage - This is not that experience. If you want a Bon Voyage style vacation, simply set somewhere to be rented in Sulani, San Myshuno, or Mt Komoreibi. This is closer to Sims 3's World Adventures, granted with less features... but better functionality. (World Adventures was always very buggy for me, with a lot of progression disconnect - Jungle Adventures ran and played pretty smooth.)",Recommended

2060,StrangerVille 리뷰,"This has been, by far, the most enjoyable addition to the Sims4, above all the expansion, and stuffs, kits etc.
Rather than feeling like the developer said ""if you're so good, you write the story!"" and you're occasionally lazy like me, you sometimes want some well written story fed to you.
This expansion isn't going to be regarded as a game equivalent of a literary classic, BUT, it's still a good story! It's not a top tier Tolkien or Star Wars level story, but it's no where near Sharknado level either.
A pretty unique world, some great set pieces, and build opportunities, and one of the few expansions where having other expansions can possibly enrich the gameplay versus ignoring any expansions you might've installed, completely. Well, okay.. being a mermaid is not going to help you here, or really anywhere outside the mermaid expansion world, but
being a werewolf, wizard, alien, or a vampire can occasionally allow you to progress in the story faster, or solve problems in a slightly different way, than without having those expansions.
If you buy ANY expansion, buy this one.",Recommended
2061,StrangerVille 리뷰,"Like pretty much everything else in the franchise, don't get this unless it's on sale, but it's definitely an interesting DLC that I don't regret buying at all.

Unlike every other Sims DLC that I've played, this one comes with a story. Set in a Rosewell-esque desert town, you quickly encounter Sims behaving strangely, and soon you're put up against a government conspiracy that seems to point to aliens. The story itself gets fairly interesting and the features it introduces lean hard into the sci-fi, Men-in-Black feel.

The town itself is surprisingly nice, if not small, so much so that I still have sims there that I play after finishing the story (which can also be reset for another Sim to play if you so choose.) I particularly like the trailer starter house on the edge of town, and the military career is a nice addition as well.",Recommended
2062,StrangerVille 리뷰,"Story is quite interesting, although it would be better if it's longer or there's plot twist and more than 1 ending, but it's quite decent. Cas are quite meh for me, some are nice but not all, but I don't think simmers will buy this pack just for cas. Bbs are quite nice tbh, but most can't use it outside of StrangerVille tho.. the world StrangerVille is beautiful, and also large for a game pack, some prebuilt lots are quite meh.. one of the lot is even from the base game Willow Creek itself.. but by just judging the world itself, it's really beautiful.

2067,StrangerVille 리뷰,"As the lowest priority among Sims Game Packs, if you are filling out a large collection this is a surprisingly pleasant pack. The replayability is very low, and it does not add much to the rest of the game experience, hence the low priority compared to other Game Packs. But it is worth the price when on sale.

The ""Strangerville Mystery"" story, delivered through an aspiration, is really fun the first time you do it - And a rather unique entry for Sims, since they have only done a few stories sorta like this through the series. You can ""reset"" the story so that another Sim in the same save can complete it if you want, though there are no alternate paths or other reason to do this. I have never encountered bugs doing this story, which I have done a few times.

The world is one of the only desert worlds, and like Oasis Springs half of it is disappointingly perfect green lawn. The desert half of this world is the tiniest of run down towns, which makes it a really great gritty location to live, though the desert itself is stunningly beautiful.

The military career is a standard rabbit hole career, however it is the highest earning career per week (by a lot) when at the max rank. This is partially because it keeps an 8hr work day for 5 days a week, while most careers drastically reduce work hours and/or days at the high end of the career. While the Officer branch of this career feels like a natural military career progression, the Covert Operator branch feels like a weird transition from the military base. Covert Operator is basically Men in Black, so it's more like the Secret Agent or TS3 police/detective careers than military. Both branches completely break from the early fitness requirements, and will require you to max skills not used before the branch promotion.

The Death by (spoiler) creates my favorite ghost type in the game. Possessed sims in general are absolutely hilarious, and interact very well with a number of other packs. Paranoid is a cute trait, that makes a lot of use of the Scared emotion.",Recommended

About the details, like

- Infected sims will talking with the tree/vegetables
- Sometimes you will see a snake in mesh going around, you can't interact with it but still look cool
- You can notice the infection in the town day by day.
- The fighting boss animation is really cool , you can spray, throw a vaccine jar (reminds me of Hematic Grenade in Death Stranding lol) And the finishing animation when you defeat the boss is very funny and cool!

Also you can live in this town. The feeling when you defeat the enemy, the town come back to normal, everybody who help you fighting the boss, gather in the bar, talking about the old time, is very unique. That make the living in this town feel more special than normal.

Of course you can go to the lab to wake up the boss and set the new mode for your own taste.",Recommended

Sims 4 StrangerVille is the 7th Game Pack released to the Sims 4, and this time they decided to change things a bit...



After playing through it, I can say that this feels like a mix of two Sims 2 era products:

-The first and very obvious is the Base Game city of Strangetown. It was first shipped with the Base Game, and it had a whole mystery, conspiracy vibe in it, with weird Aliens, pregnant men, abductions, and among others...




The mystery is interesting and the adventure that you go through in order to unveal the secrets of StrangerVille are nice.
It's not a very long story neither a very creative one, .

In the other hand, I am very fond of the world that comes with this Pack. It's big for a Game Pack, the build mode and objects are really good and useful,(but some of the lots and houses are kinda silly, especially one in particular). And it's basically a recreation of Strangetown, and me being a Sims 2, this world is quite the must for me.",Recommended

Still didn't defeat The Mother, because I like to keep my town possessed. I understand that occult and supernatural isn't everyone's cup of tea, but you can still find something that you like in this pack, for example beautiful Western desert Town, build mode objects are amazing if you are into Victorian style. Buy objects are very useful if you like to build fixeruppers and CAS items are also nice. Plus you get new personality trait, new aspiration, laptops and Military Career.",Recommended

If you play with mods, there are definitely so many mods you can install which add onto this expansion pack (eg. more after school clubs) but even if you don't and play with teens a lot adding this to your game brig so much more personality to your game.",Recommended
2088,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"Ummm...where to start.

The school is so plain as all bloody hell.
Social Bunny is probably the only cool thing in this pack along side....wait *thinks*...the town itself.
It's WAY too easy to make your sims graduate early.
When they're at school, you do THREE tasks then home. Nothing interesting whatsoever. I actually DONT want to go join the sim unless i want them to make friends; that boring.
The lunch is WAY to long. 3 hours too long.
Exam EVERY FRIDAY! why not biweekly EA?

DO NOT BUY ON FULL PRICE, you'll get buyers remorse once you check everything out. Even on a sale, it's meh.

2094,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"I wish I could rate this a 'meh'. I wouldn't pay full price for this, it feels like a game pack and not a true expansion. The high school is probably one of the worst buildings in the game outside of the ones that don't have doors or are missing a toilet or something. The teen build/buy items are pretty good and it adds a lot of character to builds having various messy items. It feels extremely half baked, it just needs more gameplay. Also why the heck would they put prom every weekend?! It should be like graduation where you can arrange the event to occur by phone. Some really bizarre gameplay decisions, although I like the event itself. You have to arrange for chess club/art club to occur by yourself via the phone which is really weird. All of this could have been solved by having prom be a 'call by phone' event. It's just such a strange implementation of gameplay where it feels like no one had any idea how to do it when they have the excellent university packs from 2 and 3 to base it off of. Really sloppy and it's a shame because the idea and objects are so fun and playing with teens is more enjoyable with at least some days spent at school. I hope it gets a refresh being a major life stage upgrade because at full price this would have been completely unacceptable but I got it 50% off basically for build/buy.",Recommended
2095,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"Enjoyable, and I do recommend it, but not as much as some packs. It fleshes out just enough to make it worthwhile, but does have distinctive cons:

Pros: Cute examples of the ""high-school experience"" where you deal with growing pains, classmates, sneaking out of the house, getting your homework and extra projects done on time, extra-curricular activities... Prom was such a cute idea to include, and it's fun making a poster to ""Prom-pose"" to someone you'd like to take. The new items were super cute as well.

Cons: Each ""year"" of school is one week in game, with prom every Saturday. I get the game moves quickly as is, but it's hard to condense down everything in like... a month. It feels *too* fast somehow. Also the school ""day"" feels super short. I don't know quite how they could fix it, but it boils down to first class, lunch, second class, go home. It would be fun to be able to answer questions at school, or deal with more ""situation"" pop-ups like you get with little kids. (""Someone made fun of another kid and your kid asked what to do... what do you suggest?"") I've never had time to actually go do cheerleading or the games, but from what I'm aware of, you don't actually *go* either. It's similar to when your Sim goes a concert, the circus, etc... they're there but you don't see it.

this was a good idea, but that's about it. it was only ever good in theory or on paper. EA's greed and willingness to continue to put out expansions that severely under-deliver and seldom function as intended is truly amazing--in the worst way.

2. Do u like after class activity like in Discover University -if u own this DLC? if YES, worth to buy.
3. Do u want ur teen sims to enroll to a university earlier? -if YES, so freaking WORTH than any consideration.

My female teen had a serious boyfriend/best friend and suddenly he just doesn't exist and she has never met him. High school reset all of the teen traits and got rid of the progress of most of the households that I played when the teens from those households came to school. It basically erased anything that I did with pre-made Sims and it really ruined the story that I had going with my favorite household. It ruined my town. On top of that, high school is just such a boring slog that I doubt I'll even bother following my Sims to school anymore. The teens are constantly stuck in the basement, I saw no way to tell them to go to class when they didn't go themselves, and it's sad how often I had to look up cheats and guides for things like joining the cheerleading activity (which seems to . Worse, my teens never get any homework to do at home anymore, so I would have to cheat to keep their grades up, but the grade cheat isn't working anymore either.

2113,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"Pros: the build and CAS objects are great. The fairground is a fine idea and good for romance. The social media tool is briefly diverting.

Cons: endless notifications about terrible high school events (why design such a huge venue for only 5 or 6 props and sims? it just looks weird); school is pretty pointless but that probably depends on how much you use the workplaces in Get to Work; school and associated events populated entirely with NPC- it is very rare to see any other of your playable teens in the same environment; I don't understand the point of Trendi. Like some of the Sims 4 packs, it's really not designed for rotational play. I haven't played it long enough to see if the NPC teens age or are stuck in eternal adolescence. The school experience is, obviously, very US-centric. Prom happens every week, it's not bad, but will get repetitive fast.

It's buggy but in minor, strange ways- for example the judging at the sports day loads Finchwick Fair text. No major bugs that are going to disrupt play.

If you like building and CAS, it's worth picking this one up on sale for the objects. The school component, unless you are a mad fan of Get to Work, you will probably do once or twice. There are mods to silence the endless notifications about events.",Not Recommended

I wanted more active focus on classes, extra curricular activities, and teen specific interractions and gameplay. Instead, the Football matches (events) are totally empty. Like, you just show up to an empty field, buy some merch, take a photo, and throw the ball. I'd have probably preferred a Rabbit Hole event with pop-ups and choices (similar to how they approached the Horse Ranch pack) to what they gave us. Also, the CAS items are so weird. Probably some of the ugliest stuff we've ever gotten. The build buy mode is a saving grace, but it's so dumb that the sneak out feature is locked to ONE window. Also -- Social Bunny. I hate it. I'm keeping this pack installed, only because I can rely on Mods to fill the gaps that the developers didn't think to fill, and I am going to pretend that stupid Trendi/ThrifTea feature is a tacky Game Pack I have in the background but will only think about when I want to take my Sims to get Bubble Tea.

It is built on the flaws of Sims4, and shows off those problems in full glory, while adding some of it's own.

Pros:
It's interesting that the ways HSY is bad, hint at the nature of flaws in EA's workplace environment.

Cons:

2147,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"this pack has been pretty controversial due to the bugs that several people have pointed out about it and many have been discouraged to buy it due to those.

me personally, i have not experienced nearly any of the bugs that are being complained about. in my opinion. this is a really nice pack!

the build/buy is where this pack really shines for me. so many new and great additions that you can add to your home and teens bedrooms to give them more personality.

the active highschool is pretty fun! i haven't gotten a chance to join any activities yet as none of them seemed to fit the teen i played this pack with first but the gameplay i have done is fun! i can see it definitely getting stale after awhile and i definitely don't go with my sim everyday, but it has been really fun! I love prom and the afterparties at the boardwalk. i don't know how graduation works though bc my sim didn't go to one? that might annoy some people but idrc that much.

the CAS is pretty much how you would expect it to be being a highschool pack. if that style is what you're into, this is definitely a pack for you. otherwise, the cas probably won't interest you much.

A big complaint for this game that has been going around since it came out was the lack of distinction between teens and young adults/adults. I think that this pack works as a decent remedy for that! The new teen-specific gameplay is really interesting and makes teens feel more like teens instead of just adults that can't do as much as normal adults.

the new world is really nice too. builders beware, the lighting is pretty weird but if that doesn't bother you then the world is one of the best to me.

Let me put it this way, Sims add-ons are like a pig in a poke. You never know what will be there.

It's not bad, but it's not worth the money. It is none. The bad and the good.

What happens in it. When a teen Sim is a teenager, he can go to school for lessons. The school itself is practically empty and sparsely furnished. There is nothing really interesting there. You can decorate the box and sit in the lessons. Alas, the free time for the Sim is rented out, only for 2 hours, and during this time he does nothing interesting.

This add-on is not tolerant of vampires and werewolves. If you play as a vampire, then he cannot eat there during breaks, although there is a cafeteria for people there, but they did not take into account the vampire - let him die of hunger. Well, at least one vending machine for creatures would be made, but no, extra joy for players is banned. As usual.

A werewolf during periods of a full moon will simply quarrel with the whole class, even if he has long and tediously established relations with them. The game, like the developers, doesn't care about werewolves.

In general, they added a good chat ""Rabbit"", where you can communicate with other Sims, but it quickly becomes boring - they say the same thing.

If you are very curious about this add-on, then I advise you to take it at a big discount. Its 39 euros is definitely not worth it. Red price 15

______________________________________________________________________________

Скажу так, дополнения Симов - это как кот в мешке. Никогда не знаешь, что именно там окажется.

Это дополнение не плохое, но своих денег оно не стоит. Оно никакое. Нехорошее и неплохое.

Что в нем происходит. Когда сим достигает подростквого возраста, он может ходить на уроки в школу. Сама школа практически пустая и скудно обставленная. Ничего там прямо интересного нет. Можно украсить ящик и посидеть на уроках. Увы свободного времени для сима дается, всего 2 часа, и за это время он ничего интересного не успевает делать.

Это дополнение не толерантно к вампирам и оборотням. Если вы играете за вампира, то кушать на перерывах он там не может хотя для людей там сделан кафетерий, но вампира они не учли - пусть с голоду дохнет. Ну хотя бы один торговый автомат для существ сделали бы, но нет, лишняя радость для игроков под запретом. Как обычно.

Оборотень в периоды полнолуния банально перессорится со всем классом, даже если долго и нудно налаживал с ними отношения. Игре, как и разработчикам, наплевать на оборотней.

В целом добавили неплохой чат ""Кролик"", где можно общаться с другими симами, но он быстро приедается - они говорят одно и тоже.

Если вам очень любопытно это дополнение то советую его брать по большой скидке. Свои 39 евро оно точно не стоит. Красная цена 15 евро.",Recommended

2161,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"The concept seems really cool, but in all honesty you are better off just downloading CC because the game is only worth the cute CAS items and build mode items.

2166,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"Do you like broken content? Do you like when none of the features work? Do you like when the features are actively worse than how something functions without an expansion? What about half-baked features? Then you'll love this pack!

So to get into a few of the positives of this pack; They made the High School easily editable, so you can get a pretty fantastic school to go to. Boba is always a thumbs up from me, however I do want more than 5 odd flavors. The BB assets from this pack are INCREDIBLE - Great bedroom furniture with a ton of varied swatches, modern computers!, and some robust decor additions so there's a bit of something for everyone. The like/dislike category of Fashion is a strong addition to the like/dislike system. The CAS items are okay, unfortunately a lot of them lack alternate swatches entirely, which would have been a huge boost to a lot of the CAS. Trendi will let you list outfits for ANY value, and they will equally all sell - Yes, I do mean that you can list an item for $9,999,999 (max simoleons) and it will sell, and it will sell just as easily as something listed for $1 or any value between. This is technically poor design, but it's so *hilariously* OP that I do consider it a positive. The Trendi system would frankly be unremarkable if it were not this absurd. The Entrepreneur mini-skill (5 ranks) is a really solid addition for other self-made money skills, like painting (and selling said paintings). More of a neutral point, but Copperdale is a pretty okay map. Except for the school, the lots are unfortunately all fairly small. Though the town area is a fairly picturesque small town, a bit charming to live in, so that's nice.

There are so many negatives with this pack that I can't really get into all of them in detail here, but for a breeze through; Teens grades do not promote, or even raise, when you follow them to High School. As the cap of Sims in an area (without mods) is 20, your school will feel very empty. Worse: Any teens that you have created that are not part of the active household will not show up at the school as NPCs. (And the mods attempting to address this are very fickle.) The setting to turn off the acne system is broken, so it will show up even if you turned it off. The shaving options will show up even if you disabled hair growth on a Sim, and there ARE NO GLOBAL HAIR GROWTH DISABLE OPTIONS. Which means that hair growth must be disabled for EVERY sim, five check boxes per sim, in different CAS categories for maximum inconvenience. MANY female NPC sims spawn with chest and/or back hair. Two of the four afterschool activities do not have events until they are requested. For the two that have events every week, both the cheerleading and football events are completely broken, and the football event is not a football game. There isn't even a way to throw the football between a group of sims, you can only toss it between two. The lot type for the Boba tea and Thrift store is ""Thrift and Bubble Tea Store"" - They MUST always both be included, which is a very arbitrary decision as these two things are not something most people consider paired. The crush system is highly arbitrary, and as of writing (months after release) still incestuous. My teens only ever get crushes on their siblings that live in the same household. NPCs frequently barge into your house and march straight up to your Sim to demand to be Best Friends. This happens to sims of ALL ages, and the NPCs doing it are of every age except toddler. The penalty for declining to be Best Friends is a massive relationship negative, and a negative sentiment (ie: This person will not be your friend anymore, and if your sim didn't really know them, they will become disliked). The rides at the pier are all rabbit holes, and have no reason to use them: Low fun gain, no sentiments (when going with someone), low relationship gain. Prom is every week, which is too often, yet the event itself is too short. The tasks at the event are mostly either janky or do not work. Meanwhile, the Career Day event only happens when requested, may not happen when requested, and is very underwhelming with nothing to do when it does.",Not Recommended

I love being able to attend school with my sim, guide her in what she needs to accomplish, and make sure we have a great year.

2175,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"To put it simply: meh. I was a little worried to buy this expansion pack based on the other reviews, but after purchasing it I haven't experienced too many bugs like others have been vocalizing about. Mods work for me and I'm able to play the game just fine since EA fixed the rapid aging and nasty incest. The only problems I do have at the moment is that my Sims text themselves as well as the actual high school not functioning great. I don't recommend this one right now because the high school is VERY bland and underwhelming. Little to no one is there, and the classrooms are plainly decorated. Prom is just an overall hot mess in the fact that it doesn't last long and there's not much to experience. Plus, Sims are still being rejected or not being asked out by the person you've built a relationship with. The CAS and build items are indeed nice, but in my opinion, it's quite minimal compared to other packs which leaves me to question why this one is worth $40. At best with what we have right now, I would price the worth to be about $15 simply because others have been having major issues, EA releasing two buggy packs in a row, barely anything to do with your teen Sims in the high school, and a serious lack of build items and CAS. Please save your money on this one since it's honestly the worst one so far; or at least until EA fixes the problematic bugs and possibly adds more things to it.",Not Recommended

2179,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"I normally don't care to leave reviews on specific Sims 4 DLCs. It's always a YMMV type of deal, and for the most part, I would say that the DLCs add *something* of value for *somebody.* Even the Werewolf DLC, which I don't care for in the slightest, gave us some pretty awesome CAS stuff and furniture, as well as a new world. Not every expansion stuck the landing, especially University, but at least it opened the gate for other aspects being fleshed out upon, especially via the community. However, this expansion? It holds the dubious honor of being the exception. This expansion managed to completely ruin Sims 4 as an experience for me. I cannot for the life of me understand how this expansion, in one fell swoop, managed to completely throw the Sims 4 into chaos and ruin not only the way the game runs, but also sent ripples into the community around it and divided it.

Outside of the new world to play in and I guess curved walls, I truly cannot find a single good thing to say about this expansion. None of what was introduced was worth the sheer chaos that happened right after this expansion dropped. Watching Maxis trying to damage control and only serving to split the base by refusing to elaborate in specifics in what is ""acceptable modding"" after a TOS change is just absolutely draining at this point. It's actually almost remarkable how much of a severely botched dumpster fire this whole thing was, and just how much damage this served to do to its own brand and community. And this is the crux of the review for me. Now, I get what you're going to say: ""Isn't it stupid to base an entire not recommended review for an expansion over things outside of the pack?""

Normally, I'd say yes. Because of the nature of modding and expansions in a continuously updating game, every expansion breaks *something.* That's just the way it is. When you download mods, you make the inherent agreement to this, and you must realize that this means things must be updated. It's sad to see what you once liked now become cyber dust, but that's not sufficient enough reason to thrash an expansion. I fully understand this, and this alone is not why I'm spending too much time and energy writing a hand wringing review. What am I writing about, however, is that in the case of this expansion, what I once considered a petty complaint carries a far different weight, because not only were literal years old systems that were under-cooked at worst and made better with mods at best changed, they were also replaced with systems that are actively worse versions of the old ones. As a result, because of the substantial way the game's scripting changed, it meant that EVERYTHING BROKE, from mods to even how older expansions worked. Literally everything that was added were originally community made mods that were BETTER and significantly less buggy, which now no longer works. This expansion is emblematic of all the worst possible changes made to the game, and as such, it is the only acceptable place for me to express ire and lament what was lost. So thus, I whine and wring my hands.

To start, I'll reiterate my point from above. The removal of the Whims system in favor of the Wants and Fears (SWAF) not only replaced a perfectly serviceable (if not a bit boring) game mechanic with something far more aggravating, but it broke EVERY SINGLE SCRIPT mod that had involved anything with traits, aspirations, jobs, gameplay mechanics, etc. So many years old mods and gameplay changes, many of which would no longer receive updates, that rested peacefully on the internet undisturbed and served to better and add variety to not only whims but gameplay as a whole, are now gone and render the game unplayable if used. And the result we got? Another broken system that relies on modders (for any that are left) to make work. I don't know how they managed to take an older Sims system, something proven to work, and somehow make it vapid and tedious to work with. Why are my Sims, who have Deeply connected sentiments and are listed as Soulmates, randomly getting the ""dream"" to break up with another, saying that they fell out of love, when NOTHING IN GAME suggests this. Why do all of my Sims randomly get ""Dreams"" of listening to every single genre of music they like? Why are my Sims who are following their dream jobs based on their interests and are getting actively promoted in them, constantly feeling like it's a ""Dead End Job"" and that they should find a new career?

You CAN'T dismiss these like you normally could either. You now have to spend satisfaction points on a Want removing potion, and guess what? That DOESN'T stop the dreams you don't want from coming up again. You have to now actively ignore them and let the game remove them itself, which in turn just stresses your Sims out and makes them Tense at best, and Angry at worst. While I can appreciate the idea of letting your Sims control the player a bit, it's far too frequent and inconsistent to be enjoyable. Normally I don't clamor about ""immersion"" in games, but this actively takes me out of feeling like I'm playing any of my characters. Nothing I do matters, and the Sims I create have no life of their own anymore, as they clearly care for nothing, not even their loved ones and dream jobs anymore. And that right there is the main resonating point of this review and my complaints:

There's no care anymore. Things are changing just to be changed, and not a single one of them has been worth it. I've never actively wished to downgrade more in my Sims 4 playtime. Things that have worked for years are now completely changed just to sell things, and the only thing it serves is just pester everyone around it. For example, did you know that any custom bed before this update is BROKEN and if you don't download a program to make a mass patch on the affected items or wait for the mods to be updated, you literally cannot place the beds in the game? Why? Because the way bed slots are formed were changed to handle the new way teens are handled. This years old system is now completely changed, and for what? Nothing that I currently care for. And that's not it either! The way the cellphone system is handled is different, and at the risk of sounding like an crotchety Boomer, ALL OF your Sims (yes, not just the teen ones) are now hopelessly addicted to their phones. Any interaction is buffered by your Sims checking their ""Social Bunny"" account that they never made, and their walk cycles for everything are changed to be glued to their phone at all times... even if they are a WEREWOLF MID SPRINT. Running inside from the storm? Marching in the military? Heart to heart conversations with your loved one? Clearly not important enough for your Sims to stop checking their stupid Social Bunny account.

Of course, bugs aren't anything new to Sims 4, right? Remember when your saves were just getting bricked with the Save Error 0 nonsense in the Wedding expansion? Well, when this first came out, you probably either had your saved bricked by the very scripting itself changing mid way through, OR you set your sims aging to Long and then had your Sims age up and die at an accelerated rate after going into CAS or going on vacation. Yes, that was a real bug that this expansion SHIPPED OUT WITH, and later had to be fixed POST LAUNCH. The curved walls they brought on weren't properly adjusted for the game, thus leaving holes in the walls and ceilings when trying to build with them. The Wants and Fears system made your Sims want to date their own family members. How did this get past play testing? Why were these shipped out??

Why? Because there's no care anymore. Like my Sims, Maxis lost their vision, their passion. And there isn't a ""Regain Passion"" prompt they can click on to solve this dumpster fire. This is an outrageous slap to the face for any Sims fan. This is a hopeless mess. Save your time and energy and just avoid. 40 bucks worth of McDonald's is a better investment than this.",Not Recommended
2180,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"For context, I sincerely enjoy The Sims 4 quite a lot despite coming from The Sims 3, and every pack I have was bought on sale save for this one and the My Wedding Stories pack. Most Steam reviews are dog piling and whining, especially for this game, so I'm attempting to be as realistic and forthcoming with this pack as possible.

High School Years is an interesting one, to say the least. So many good ideas. So much fun and realism mixed with an idealistic portrayal of high school. The entire tone is sweet and comforting, almost like a sitcom you grow up with. In many ways this pack is a little bit of a piece of art. Or at least it would have been with a bit more thought.

At the end of the day, High School Years is a great idea hindered by the same issues almost all the Sims 4 packs have. Clunky mechanics. I WANT to not just like this pack, but LOVE it. And in many ways I do, it does a lot really, really right. But there's so many other things that make the whole pack just stumble over itself like a toddler tripping over its own feet. Expanded teen gameplay was a huuuuuuuuuge part of my interest in this pack, and in some ways they delivered. High School itself is built to be fun and laid back at the cost of realism. Most of your sim's time is spent in early morning free time or on lunch break, which allows for a retrospectively accurate experience. We don't remember the bland and normal classes, we remember those moments between them, dotted with our friends and our interactions with them. Tiny moments. And this pack is full of them. They're just constantly punctuated with sims standing around doing absolutely nothing, timers and events that zoom by and end before you realize it, and shallow gameplay that is exciting at first but quickly turns into just another day of the same old same old.

PROS:

- New world, Copperdale, which is perhaps my favorite so far. Clearly inspired by games like Life Is Strange and maybe a dash of Netflix's I'm Not Okay With This. Very charming and very cozy, with a few tiny spots here and there for hangouts.

- Playable high School experience a la Get to Work or the Acting career. Goals are straightforward and reasonable, and even a bit realistic for the setting.

- For the first time ever Prom is now an actual playable event

- A few new townies with lovely family dynamics and interesting stories

- A plethora of build and CAS items designed for teen sims (but that can occasionally work for adults). I watched the livestream for this pack and the devs mentioned how they partook in some high school themed media to gather inspiration for this pack, and that is clearly evident in the CAS items. Many of them instantly reminded me of movies like 10 Things I Hate About You, Clueless, and Mean Girls. All your favorite subcultures are in this pack. As far as CAS goes, they knocked it out of the park on this one.

- Amusement Park rides are built into the new world, Copperdale, as there is a boardwalk with a haunted mansion, a ferris wheel, and a tunnel of love. Essentially small rabbitholes. But at least they're there, I guess.

- A social media app called Social Bunny. Basically twitter mixed with some Facebook. Easy way to build relationships if used correctly.

- Body hair!

- This pack also saw the inclusion of sexual orientation and romantic orientation to the base game, which is a nice addition

- Teen-specific aspirations with rewards that serve well into adulthood.


CONS (there are many):

- The high school gameplay quickly gets old, and at some point becomes downright painful. As mentioned previously, it is a goaled event a la Get to Work jobs and the acting career. The goals themselves are fairly simple. Work on a treadmill, study for exams, be friendly with a student, be friendly with the faculty, etc. But sims move *so* slowly. And I mean so slowly. I struggled to complete the goals simply because it takes forever and a year to walk from the sidewalk, into the school, down the stairs, to the treadmill. Then my sim has to stop staring into oblivion for whatever reason so they can begin running on said treadmill. Then once the goal has decided its been completed, the sim must take 10-15 minutes of in-game time to think about his life and all that has lead him to that moment before getting off the treadmill. Now I want him to study for exams? Well no problem there, sir. Lets take a nice 30 minute stroll up the stairs to the furthest away seat in the cafeteria before we even think about opening up those textbooks. What's this? Class starts in three minutes? Well you might as well let him study because either way the poor dude is gonna be late. It's painful and infuriating to watch, This is no longer charming. It renders most gameplay worthless because I spend more time watching my sim sit around with his thumb up one of his bodily holes than actually watching him interact with anything.

- Prom is done and over with in the blink of an eye. It starts at i think 7pm and ends at like 10pm. And for whatever reason the award ceremony and the subsequent reaction to it is like an hour and a half of that. It is also a goaled event, and will always require you to vote for prom royalty, vote for prom jester, eat something, drink something, dance, use the photo booth, show off outfit, dance, dance with another sim, dance, and thats as far as I made it because by then prom was over. And I still only earned silver. If you manage to earn gold on prom then you're either cheating or the sim gods themselves have blessed your sim with moderate intelligence rather than the painful and obvious mental deficiency all of mine seem to have every time. Dancing is the worst though, because the game is NOT clear about what counts as ""dancing with another sim."" I've had mine dance and then invite someone over to dance, and sometimes that counts. But other times it doesn't, and I waste an hour of prom time dancing like Carlton in the episode of Fresh Prince where he accidentally takes speed. Slow dancing or sweetheart dancing NEVER seems to work and I'm not sure if that's a bug or a feature because the game just refuses to comment on any of that at all.

- Prom's charm is entirely lost because it's EVERY. SINGLE. SATURDAY. Regardless of what mode you play on. Ridiculous. But this further exasperates the issues because I had FIVE ATTEMPTS at completing Prom with a gold rank and NEVER got it. Is this what you wanted Maxis? Did you want a grown man with a wife and a job to sit here and actually STRESS over an arbitrary reward in your poorly designed game? I hope you're happy with yourself. I work in a kitchen. I thought I was stronger than this. But I swear to glob if I get another silver on prom I'm gonna punch the next person that walks by my front door. Anyways,

- Social Bunny is so painfully underdeveloped that I almost wish they hadn't included it at all. It IS a nice feature to have, but its so boring after the first day that I ended up getting rid of my sim's account. It's just a mishmash of the same jokes and random complaints about prom over and over again. Seriously. Complaints about prom and posts about pillow fighting are just about all you see on it. The fact that Social Bunny was built for the teen experience and nothing more is so obvious that it's baked into every interaction. There are no memes, no complaints about the potholes on Main Street, no one talking about how their good for nothing nephew just can't seem to get their lives together. Even the adults post about how great prom was.

Do I recommend High School Years? No. There's so many features in this DLC I haven't mentioned because they didn't work well enough for me to actually play through them or they happened so little that I forgot they were even in the game, and those that did work were horribly conceived or straight up broken. If Maxis fixes their game, maybe then it'll be worth it.",Not Recommended

As well as the inconsistent prompts to accompany your teens to school.

EA suggests that mods or custom content could be to blame. I have used mods for years, as well as being a massive fan of this franchise. I have had no significant problems until now regarding the use of mods and the game itself, which seems to be a daily occurrence. Before you ask, YES!!!

2185,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"Completely broken. Worse than Dine Out.

Not a single aspect of this pack meets the mark. It's light on CAS items, light on Build Items, and the worst part about the companion updates is that it completely breaks the game.

Wants and fears were haphazardly designed and implemented - fear moodlets overwhelming sims and making them constantly sad or angry. Autonomy is making sims behave in ways that are a huge waste of time or not in character at all. Social Bunny would be a much better feature if it was more carefully designed and completely implemented. The high school day is broken in all regards - sims being late all the time, wasting time on everything you can think of, and subsequently failing at school because of all of it.

This expansion is a disaster. Not a single aspect of it works, and the system benefits once again have me and the sims community repeating what we've wanted for years: FIX THE GAME!

Just fix the game. All these left behind mechanics and functions and nothing was carefully and completely finished out and hooked up to existing systems. This is not how you do a simulation game of any kind!

2186,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"I am honestly overall having fun with this expansion pack despite the fact that some bugs still need fixing. Their are only three noticeable major bugs I have experienced while playing with this expansion pack and while they are annoying they are not game breaking either. Number 1, sims entering buildings without permission and without knocking which sometimes that option to send a sim home is not available forcing to me lock every single door since they will sneak into some other door without permission besides front door if not all doors/windows(""high school years window"") are locked for everyone, except household members and maybe briefly open for parties, number 2 getting asked sometimes to be boyfriend/girlfriend or best friend can be mildly annoying sometimes that may involve sims entering a building without permission while doing that but I always say no despite the negative affect it has on friendship, and number 3 the graduation day ceremony possibly could still be bugged but I was surprised that you could still attend the ceremony on a Sunday even if not invited as a young adult after graduating from high school if you get there on time at around 6:00 p.m and reach young adult no later than Saturday. I would not recommend this as one of your first ever expansion packs and not without the MCCC mod either, and using social bunny I suspect may sometimes result in negative moodlets for my sims (although, there is an option to ""deactivate social bunny"" anytime if you are getting annoyed by it), but overall I am having fun with it despite the bugs.",Recommended
2187,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"So I've only just got some sims to the point of being ready for highschool, (This is because of the previous ageing bug and the fact I CANNOT stand the werewolf DLC... but that's another story this is not about that)
I wish there was a button for ""It's okay"" instead of the YES/NO recommendation.

So yes, this DLC is okay. I like the school interactions but they only attend 2 classes a day and have a 3 hour lunch? They expect you to do loads of interactions in such short amounts of time - this is the school day and the prom... and I'm finding that a lot of the time my sim is just going to flat out ignore me and do what they want anyway (okay... cool cool cool cool...)

I like the new ideas and the new things teenagers can do so they do'nt just feel like useless adults anymore, but yeah everything just feels so rushed. I'm still having dfun with it, and I don't think it will go the way of the werewolf dlc i.e. never to be used again.... (I couldn't even remove the werewolf trait with the testing cheats.. it just kept on coming back!!!! ARGH..RIP Emily.)

I'm all for new content though, I love to build more than play the game so this is why I enjoy it.",Recommended

2189,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"It's an okay DLC? I feel like it could of been a lot more than it came out as, but I do find it fun to turn the entire school into a monster school. Wish they added some more jobs like being able to become a teacher, or being able to have the principal retire so your sim can become the new one or something. Even the ability to make more schools in different worlds would make this DLC 10 times more better. I also wish CC would appear in the 'create look' cas, but it's understandable why it's not there. The clothing options this DLC brings is pretty good, but honestly that's all I really like about this DLC.

I'm also quite disappointed by the death by urban legend. I adore urban legends and have been looking into a lot of them recently. I saw a clip of the death and it's pretty disappointing. I feel like it would be so much cooler if there was a like- self employed career for teens and older where you can go investigate urban legends around Copperdale, and some of those urban legends have a chance of killing your sim. I feel like the death could of been much more and even though it's such a small feature like a death, I still feel like it would of been pretty cool.

Overall, pretty disappointed by this DLC. It could of been a lot more than it came out as.",Not Recommended

2194,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"ASIDE FROM THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT DIDN'T SET-UP THEIR GAME PROPERLY:

This DLC worked out of the box for me because I had the aging turned off. I also used the newest MCCC download which I read on the EA forum, caused the most problems. Other than that, this is MUCH better than the University DLC that I got years ago. Now only if EA would update that DLC so that the students can attend live classes.

Now if you have the Go to Work and Famous DLC, the High School DLC works in a similar fashion. When the time comes, you can follow your teen to school and attend classes the whole day. To me, the included playable Sims were one of the best that Maxis had ever created including a Trans/Queer student. The interaction was fun and the teacher in the class made it seem you were in a real class. During off class/school time, there was much more to do. The amusement park next to the ocean is amazing at night. The graphics for this DLC is pretty amazing. One thing I liked about this DLC is that you can actually rebuild the school itself. There's an nice amount of rebuilds from out community in the Gallery.

Sadly this DLC has it flaws. The Prom and Graduation comes quick, so you have to decide if your teen Sims move on or just stay going to school for the rest of their Sim lives. Before the hot fix, the Prom had it's issue. Seems like it's working now. To me, this DLC is one of the better ones.",Recommended

Especially all the anime things! I would say wait to get the pack for a bit so they can fix problems, but if you don't mind dealing with them or you get lucky like me and don't have consistant glitches, the items and customization is really great and I love the atmosphere of it.

Some people says if glitchy, but for me it doesn't lag and it only sometimes doesn't work.
Ok thats what I saw- but I also saw someone say the Social bunny app is pretty useless, but i disagree.
I also like how you can get boba in this pack and create outfits and get profits from the outfits, even as a teen, not only an adult. And they added so many cute things like new computers, desks, and some things to go on floors. The beds are cute too! One of my favorite things is all the cute things you can put on the walls, it makes my sims rooms look so much better. They also added adorable things in CAS, like the bucket hat! I also love the fact you can make your own school, although there isn't much at school, it does give you something to do and a new thing to build. Also i love how you can now sneak out!
Oh and if there is any bugs, they will probably fix it in one of the patch notes, so watch out for those bug fixes!

Oh and I saw someone talking about the school they give you, there is only 2 classes and 2 teachers and not enough teen, but if there was more classes where would the teens be in those classes? We can't have that many teens, I also saw them say its very empty, like a lot of EA builds, but thats where the fact that you can edit it comes in handy.",Recommended

Its huge and empty and all the activities feel like a one trick pony. I thought the Boba and thrift store would be two separate places but they arent its all the same building. The promos show very lively and colorful school halls but its empty and bland. Very underwhelming. The school day goes by so fast because sim time is fast so you dont get to experience any real content its like a drive thru lesson. There class, 2 hour lunch, class, then its over.

Live out high school similar to uni expansion but not as fleshed out
Get to do school events such as a science fair, after school clubs and even prom.
New genders ect for those who have asked for it.

Cons:
Very little content in grand scheme of things, a sim on automated can pass everything easily
Mobile phone interface has changed so you need to get familiar with that fast to do anything.
If your sim is a celebrity, everyone shares that rank. Eg if your a Global superstar, so is everyone else.
House keeps disappearing along with all objects.
If you made money it disappears.
Social Bunny (Sims Facebook in game) keeps removing friends
Sims save file does not save completely and causes crashes


In short, fun idea but not play tested and bug fixed. At this point my game is broken so not playing it until it has been patched and fixed.

It's a buggy mess though. It's pretty unplayable honestly. I have all the items, all of the aspirations, all the traits. But the bugs ruin the game. The cheer meets? Yeah, I can't do anything but eat food and chat, My cheerleader can't participate. Says there's more than seven cheerleaders, but there were three on the mat. And no others anywhere nearby. I don't even get the football competition at all. And prom?

Well, the first time I couldn't go to prom because I saved and went into the world map on Thursday evening. And when I went back into my household it was Monday at 3:30 in the morning. It just skipped the whole weekend (this was the first week of the game, and I still had everything I accomplished that week... it just skipped ahead.

Next attempt at prom? Well, I had my date and we were ready. Saturday at 7 rolls around and nothing. No invites, no notices. Travelled to the auditorium and no prom. Oh, Skill Day was the next day. That never happened either.

Already set aging to normal so no one spontaneously passed away. I did have people randomly turning into celebrities and names of items disappearing. Even exam day was super laggy. The entire venue froze or would stutter through and even clicking on an item to attempt to interact would lag quite hard. I was honestly waiting for the game to crash, but it powered on through. Will probably let them go to exam day on their own in the future to avoid this.

Overall though, since I was prepared for the frustration I could potentially experience I had quite a good time. Had a friend incredibly invested in the drama going on in my household with my teen. Was honestly more annoyed at the building aspect and curved walls on an upper floor interfering with item placement on the floor directly below along with the same fears constantly popping up.

2227,하이스쿨 라이프 리뷰,"This is a trainwreck of a DLC.

Now, there are a select few here in the reviews section who are incessantly insisting that it's not that bad. These people are..... not quite correct.

I have delved into the depths of this content and I have little, if anything, good to say about this rampant dumpster fire of a release. There are so many bugs I don't even know where to start. The fact someone, somewhere approved this to be released to the public is mind-boggling. It's the type of content that makes you question if it was even tested before it was released. Furthermore, there is nothing I have found in this $40 DLC that you cannot already get in the FREE Go To School mod, except for a handful of different characters, some new clothes/hairstyles and a few extra curricular activities. Now, do these extra curricular activities offer any sort of content that is worth more than $5, you might ask?

LOL

I'll break down my experience for you:

The football activity: I was most excited for this particular feature after hearing the hype around the release. What it actually amounts to is sending your Sim to practice on their own and practicing throwing a football with someone in your free time. Every week there is a ""sports day"" where you can take selfies in front of a football-themed wallpaper on campus. That's .... it. There is supposedly some sort of competition where Sims can take turns throwing footballs, but this... does not work... like, not even a little bit.

The cheerleading activity: Slightly better than the football activity's ""sports day,"" the only difference here being that you can band seven school cheerleaders together to have some sort of dance battle against.... (???) no one. No one competes against you, you just do a 30 second dance and then are told you've lost (until you have 10/10 fitness).

The prom feature: What prom feature? There is no notification urging or allowing you to attend when the time comes, even if you have a date. You can try to travel to the school or auditorium by yourself at the correct day and time, only to find them both ghost towns. You can also be inexplicably turned down for prom by Sims with whom you have maxed out your romance skill.

The best friend feature: You will be repeatedly bombarded 9-10 times a day, by any Sim you've ever talked to, demanding that you become best friends with them. There is also a bug where everyone you know will become mad at you, and expect an apology for seemingly no reason.

The sneaking out feature: I got a notification to sneak out of my house to go to a concert while I was at the gym. I was eager to try the feature, so I traveled back home, walked through the front door, then proceeded to sneak out through my window. My Sim went by themself to the concert for all of 3 minutes and then teleported back to where they had sneaked out, as if nothing had happened.

The social media feature: At first I thought this was kind of cool. There is now a social media app called AnyBunny where you can message friends, post on a newsfeed about events you've been through, react to what others have posted, etc. This has a lot of potential. The only problem is, there are about 6 scripted messages you can post, all of which grow extremely tiresome after 15 minutes on the app. After about an hour, your newsfeed will be bloated with countless identical posts about how other Sims were just in a pillow fight. Also, my ""followers"" count got suck at 26, despite having close to 100 ""friends"" on the app.

I could keep going, but honestly, I feel like I've already wasted enough time playing and ranting about this .... thing I paid $40 for. And I can assure you that, in it's current condition, I wouldn't even play it for free.",Not Recommended

My only complaint with this expansion pack is ordering food in the cafeteria is such a huge pain. I eventually gave up on trying to order food and just used the vending machine instead. Basically all the teens crowd where you order food and make it nearly impossible to actually order food. I had my sim order a sandwich and then out of nowhere it just disappeared??? I saw it and clicked to eat it but then it just disappeared??? Do not order food, just prepare it at home and take a sack lunch or go to a vending machine (which is more expensive.)

Here's the context: The free update released in preparation for this, I could forgive. I was able to be on the game and had a few things of the wants and fears issues and bugs with a few others that have already been addressed on social media. However, now I had no idea that it would be THIS BAD.
I was able to get on the game ONCE after installing, and then nothing. I had no text for my aspirations. I was so confused and made sure all my mods and CC were removed but still didn't help and then I couldn't get on the game, at all. Still can't. It won't even open. So, before this was installed I had a great time playing the game. Then I installed it and everything FELL APART. I couldn't get on the game, I tried fixing it by going offline and online again. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the pack. I'm just sick of messing around with any of this anymore, I could just about forgive My Wedding Stories and then Werewolves was good in my opinion, just entirely underused. Now, we just have broken. I thought My Wedding Stories was bad, and then we have BAD.

Edit: Worked eventually, and is quite fun to play around with. However, I've not tried it with mods or CC so not sure how it'll react AND I only got to play it finally after a few hours of messing with it. Not sure if it's worth the whole ordeal and stress but happy it's working finally.

CAS has some very cute hairs and clothes, tho I would have appreciated some more jewelry. The world is gorgeous and I love how open it is! Snowboarding, skiing, rock climbing are all fun, relaxing in the onsen is a good way for your sims to chill in the water without freezing to death. The festivals are a lil repetitive but nothing bad.

2295,겨울이야기 리뷰,I HONESTLY LOVE THIS PACK,Recommended
2296,겨울이야기 리뷰,"out of every expansion pack for the sims, this is probably one of the better one imo!

One of my favorite parts of this pack is the new world. Mt. Komorebi is one of the prettiest worlds in the game to me, and you'll especially like it if you love winter/snow! (This world is snowy, even if you don't have seasons!). Also the builds in this world are actually really good (unlike some of the other worlds cough cough get famous, realm of magic, strangerville, etc). The sims should definitely get more sims youtubers and stuff to build their worlds because it pays off in the quality of their builds.
It comes with many new skills, such as rock climbing, snowboarding, and skiing. These skills are pretty fun honestly I love watching my sims snowboard.
Climbing Mt. Komorebi is pretty fun too but also a little anti-climatic. There was also a bug where it wouldn't let me get past a certain stage of climbing the mountain that i needed a mod to fix, and I dont think that the bug got fixed so keep that in mind. Climbing the mountain is pretty much something you'll probably only do once while playing tho.
This also adds a new feature of lifestyles. It sounded pretty cool in theory but honestly I don't think that it has much of an impact on the gameplay as i barely notice a difference when my sim has a lifestyle vs when they don't
The CAS isn't the most life-changing. A lot of it is skiing/snowboarding gear (like snow pants, big jackets, etc) but there are some cute sweaters and hairs that I like a lot.
The build/buy stuff is pretty cool too. It's a lot of Japanese style furniture and architecture which I think is really cool, so if you're into that, you'll love the build/buy mode of this pack.
Overall, I can't think of many objectively bad parts of this pack other than some of the gameplay features getting boring over time. Most of the features of this pack is based on personal preference.",Recommended
2297,겨울이야기 리뷰,"This expansion offers a new world of lots of snow~! I really enjoy this world. I've had a sim (or 2) live there and gardening is still possible~! (indoors or create a greenhouse)

I enjoy this pack.

If you build a lot with a pond in this world, the pond doesn't ever seem to de-ice. haha but it's still pretty. Too bad we can't ice fish~!

Free update come to mind with anyone for ice fishing? I got this one on sale for half off some time back. I think this one was about $20 when I got it and tbh, with the new world, designs, furniture and abilities, I found this one worth it.

I have many, many of the packs. MANY of them. Some, like wedding stories, I've hesitated with intentionally. This one I do not regret. It depends on what you enjoy, and what you expect from a pack like this. Maybe watch some gameplays on youtube?

Read other reviews, both positive and negative. Read recent ones for most updated reports from users, but remember, simmers come in ALL ages and ALL desire types, as well as all over the world. :) So, really, it comes down to what you are hoping for if you spend the amount it costs to get this DLC .

I've had this pack for some time, and it's now 2023 so I'd think they'd offer a better sale at some point???

Partial Quick List:

Pros: Lots of them :) Fun pack with new activities, new build items, new buy items. New fun (steamy fun for couples).

Cons: price, publisher greed, some bugs, no ice fishing in frozen ponds",Recommended
2298,겨울이야기 리뷰,"Not only does this add more diversity into the game from one of the few worlds not American based with descent CaS and build items in addition to some interesting new gameplay elements, but I was also able to have a sim successfully climb up Mt. Komorebi as well without any issues or bugs along the way. I did not need any special mods either for completing this climbing event. If anyone was still having issues with Mt. Komorebi since the infant update hopefully it was fixed now.",Recommended
2299,겨울이야기 리뷰,"I was hesitant to put this on my wishlist, but I'm so glad I did. First of all, I adore the Japanese aesthetic and the neighborhoods. The small details like utensil preferences (chopsticks or forks) and no shoes house rules also add to the vibe. But most of all, the hiking has got to be my favorite addition to the game. While the snowboarding/skiing is a little meh, the hiking features gorgeous views, unique moodlets, and a whimsical aspect with the forest spirits. As of the infants update the mountain excursion is broken, but that is easily fixed with a mod and very enjoyable (just make sure your sims are very skilled in rockclimbing or they will literally fall and die).",Recommended
2300,겨울이야기 리뷰,"This pack is amazing, for some people it's quite boring pack but for me I absolutely love this pack. The Japanese-based new world Mt. Komorebi is so beautiful, the view, the lots are all gorgeous. New festivals are quite cool too, especially the Festival of Snow. Although I don't always go to the festivals, but they are definitely fun to join. As an Asian, I like how it has a new world and features based on East Asia, which is Japan, all previous dlcs are European/Caucasian based. The no shoes sign and using chopstick instead of fork(utensil preference) are nice small details. Like I said, I'm an Asian, hence I almost put no shoes sign in every single house, yeah I feel uncomfortable if they stepping on carpets or sleeping on sofa with shoes on x.x. The lifestyle does not affect to my gameplay that much, but it's a nice feature to have. I love the emotionally mindful state, especially when I'm making my sims to do specific mindful hobbies or stuff xD, I like how you can surge emotion when you have the +10 Fine moodlet, Controlled Emotions. The snow activities on Yukimatsu are fun to play, but I don't really go there that often to increase their snow activities skills.",Recommended
2301,겨울이야기 리뷰,It's a good pack and all but it's kind of a one time use for me and theres not much too it its basically the same as all other packs a new world new items and a one thing to really do this is kinda how I feel about all packs beside cottage living but I just don't see how great it is. it also makes my game crash a lot and extremely laggy I don't know why that happens but it's not a good pack to me.,Not Recommended
2302,겨울이야기 리뷰,"I miss Japan so this pack is on the top of my priority list. It reminds me of snowy Japan town where I used to live long ago, so I'm buying this because of the nostalgia, so it might be different for you.

Instead of the bustling Tokyo, they chose the slow-pace town life which I like. There are three areas - snowy mountain, town with beautiful hiking place, and town with children festival. My single sim in Willow Creek always go to Mt. Komorebi for vacation and sightseeing.

The thing i like the most is the meditative walk or hiking. Instead of jogging, the sims can walk in the beautiful scenery, alone or in group. When my sim goes hiking or meditative walk, it feels like semi-open world to me. And, the build item i like the most is the kotatsu and hot pot. Finally a table where you can sit down on the floor. Kotatsu and hot pot (nabe) are very common items in Japan especially in snowy area.

They did a nice job incorporating the concepts of some Japanese culture - tanabata where you write your wish & put on a bamboo tree, small bonfire which reminds me of bon odori, lantern (although it doesn't light on my non-gaming laptop..), amulet at shrine. Honestly gameplay-wise there's nothing much to do regarding those things I mentioned other than simple interaction, so these might not be too interesting or boring if you don't know or don't care much about Japanese culture (because not much gameplay in Sims overall, not only in this pack), but can be a starting point for you to learn about the Japanese culture in real life, or even give some ideas for your vacation plan to Japan (like where to go for snowboarding or hiking), or when you would like to try to emulate some of these in your real life (the simplest one would be simple tanabata imho).

Of course there are so much more in real-life Japan compared to this minuscule Sims version, but I really appreciate the team's effort on incorporating Japanese culture. The builds and world are beautiful, if you're the type who appreciate beauty of Sims world then you might like it. If you're a gameplay-focused type of Simmers, or if you don't care much about the Japanese culture mentioned above, you might find it a bit boring (but this might be true for all expansions, not only this pack, since overall Sims 4 lacks in gameplay, imho).

Honestly Sims world, no matter which pack, feels so limited, so at first I was kinda disappointed (because of the limited lots, but this is true for all packs though), but I really like how it reminds me of the Japan area that I love. Also, like other packs, when I see other people's gameplay or builds videos/articles, then I know how to explore the packs. Like all of the other packs, Sims 4 DLC's are recommended on sale.

In short, I love this pack. Thanks team for making it happen,",Recommended

Should items of real world culture be added for a price? No. If an item of Arabic/religious significance can be added for free, aspects of other cultures should not have an additional price point added to them. The cultural items could have been add to the game for free to add hype for this pack instead of being the main motivation some people might get it. If things like calendars, moon phases, and *TODDLERS* can be added for free to act like advertisement for the packs that support them, the same could have been true for this pack too. I do not care if it adds a playable town, new clothing options, furniture/build mode items, and new aspects of game play, cultures should not be exploited for monetary gain like a depiction of religious temple in the New Testament in The Bible, for even those merchants got their comeuppances for their greed.",Not Recommended

Sims can also climb the mountain. There are also vending machines. Sims can hike and walk together while talking, which is cute but I wish they can do this everywhere and not just in Mt. Komorebi. There is also an onsen bathhouse. There is also that thing where you have to remove your sims' slippers/shoes before entering the house. Sims in Mt. Komorebi are also wearing uniforms automatically when they go to school.

Snowy Escape--you only want to get this if you want a vacation world for your sims, or if you're a builder and want Japanese-inspired items, or if you're a collector or whatever. But honestly, for its price, wait for a sale. Snowy Escape is not a priority for you to get, you'll not miss anything really big. Check for other packs instead.",Recommended

2313,겨울이야기 리뷰,"Value wise, this EP doesn't come close to the other DLC's like City Living, Cottage, or Get Together. IMO what makes this EP good are the Activities. Climbing, Skiing, Snowboarding, Hot Spa to name a few. Some people praise the items you get in Building mode. Yes there are good but it's mostly focus to Mt. Komorebi. I mean, you wouldn't want to build a Japanese style home in Windenburg would you? To each their own I guess. The weekly events are cool. The amount of clothes in CAS is another nice aspect of this EP. Lot wise, the closer to the Mountain, the more snow you get. As a matter of fact the lots near the mountain stay snowy forever, and if you have Seasons DLC, the snow will not melt in the Summer. Overall I would rate this pack a 6 out of 10. It's not a bad pack and it's also not the best pack. Get this if you're bored and want to do snow sports and activities. Pass if it's not on sale.",Recommended

This world is great, though it feels too small because the ski/resort area is all rentals. It's all beautiful and adds a really unique visual to the game.

The various mountaineering activities and gameplay are fun, but add relatively little to the game. Kind of one-and-done experiences.

2321,겨울이야기 리뷰,"I own, and have played, every Expansion pack for the Sims 4 except for Cottage Living. I've found that even the ones that I'm not too big a fan of (like Discover University or Eco Lifestyle) I at least play them because they add something meaningful to the game, even if it's something small. Snowy Escape, on the other hand, offers almost nothing. There are festivals, but I almost never go to them, unlike the ones in City Living. I hardly ever get a notification about these festivals and your sim doesn't get an invite to them from NPC sims. I am also vaguely aware of where they are located. The aesthetic is poor to me. I thought living in a Japanese style town would be cool, but it's small and grey with nothing but spas and a bar in it. The big selling point is the skiing aspect, which is a vacation spot and not a place that you can visit just to pursue an after work hobby. Meaning you have to either not have a job or have a vacation day or two that you can use to trek on up there. The skiing itself is very boring and not all that interesting, imo.

2330,겨울이야기 리뷰,"This is an absolutely beautiful Japan themed pack. They did a very lovely job of representing a lot of different aspects of Japanese culture and architecture, and then threw some winter sports in! The winter sports/adventures are neat I guess, but I would recommend getting this if you want Japan themed stuff, not for snowboarding (which is a little meh). Lifestyles are a little hit-or-miss with me; I love the idea, and the way they work is fantastic, but the variety of Lifestyles is not very robust, and the control over which ones you'll develop are very poor. As of writing this, there are no mods that I know of that do a notable job of expanding on Lifestyles. (Though there are a handful of older mods out there that have a similar function, but in their own modded systems.)

Compared to other Expansions, I rate Snowy Escape as a middle-low priority. If you really want Japan building / neighborhood themes, you will probably bump that priority up to middle-high, and I think you will be pretty happy with this pack. But more aesthetic preference agnostic, it adds less features with a smaller scope than a lot of the other expansions.",Recommended

2343,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"Would've got this way sooner if I knew all the build/buy was Art Nouveau inspired!!!!
I'm a bit biased towards this DLC as a huge fan of that design style, but I have genuinely found the rest of it enjoyable so far. I was skeptical because some people said there wasn't much new content added, but I kind of disagree with that. I do agree that the world and the magic realm added are a bit small, and there are a few buggy things like the duels that can be a bit of a pain. It would also be cool if other forms of Sims could be Spellcasters instead of having it as a life state.
However, I personally find being a Spellcaster to be a lot of fun for being a chaotic individual (I have burgliated and inferniated so much stuff) and just for some general convenience things. The CAS isn't anything too special, although I really like the accessories. And although they are admittedly quite useless and I wish more was done with them, I do love having familiars following me around. I think it's a fun showcase of the current Sim's personality. Or maybe I just want a pet raven. Anyway.

I've created a magical sim and she's fun. For some reason, Sulani has a lot by a volcano that sims seem to love to trespass on. My magical sim was reading some magic books and didn't see the stranger sim just trot on in, drink 3 glasses of water and take a seat at my dining table there. Very strange that these sims do this.

I decided to try to make them go away w/o greeting them bc .... who are they anyhow? So I casted the Spark spell. After the 3rd one, he got very upset and left.

The town, it's sort of boring for it being a place of Magic.
The clothes are okay.
I'm really liking the furniture. It reminds me of the Disney Game's Furniture of wood and blue ♥ The price of this one isn't doubled up. I was happy to see that. Whatever discount I got on it, I found it worth it for what I expected and I'm happy with mine so far.

2374,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"Realm of Magic pros and cons.

Lets start with the cons, the world building in this game pack, much like most of the Sims 4 game packs, is mediocre at best. It's similar to all other locations but with a different skin applied, its the same kinda things you interact with and people you talk to. You pick up plants for potions, you study magic by reading and dueling or you can learn from chatting with other wizards and witches, just like you learn any other skill in the base game. I had kinda hoped they would have done it like in Harry Potter, where you could get invited to a school and attend an actual school for wizards, kinda like the university packs. Instead of just jumping into a portal and run around a mad house talking to strangers.

Wands and brooms are also a thing in this pack, but they are kinda useless, there isnt really more to add to that, they are just visual props your simmer can flex with.


There are a total 24 spells in this game pack, split across 3 schools of magic. Practical which has nine spells, Mischief got seven, and Untamed magic that has eight. There is also a total of 15 different potions which can be brewed, these are brewed in huge cauldrons, kinda like cooking.

What I like about this pack is all the spells you can use in the ""real world"", like setting things on fire, cloning yourself, annoying and softcore torturing other summers around town, even force friendships and romance.

Bloodlines are also kinda cool, the purer your blood, the stronger of a magic boost your character will have, so e.g. if both your simmers parents and grandparents are all wizards and witches, your character will have quite an advantage compared to someone with no magic in their bloodline.


This pack like all the others, also comes with props, clothing and hairstyles.",Recommended
2375,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"DO NOT BUY THIS DLC!!!! Its totally broken. When i go to create a sim and do a spellcaster sim, it bugs out bad and all facial features are gone. Only thing that remains, are eyeballs, teeth, and hair. First one ive downloaded that is this broken.",Not Recommended

2377,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"It's just so boring, the first spell you learn in the pracitcal school replaces the need to shower completely and the first potion satiates all your needs. If you want to start low and get your sim to work their way up to get a nice life, it's done in 5 minutes as long as you have apples.
The magical world is just so empty and the duels are neither engaging, nor balanced, it's just random with no user input.
That's basically all this pack has to offer.

I remember the magic expansion from The Sims 1 which was really awesome, changed the gameplay without breaking the game. It made you play around the mechanics, gave you a sweet world to explore and tons of things to do. You could breed your own dragon and it had a nice dueling system where you actually had user inputs.",Not Recommended
2378,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"Love occults so it's a great pack for me. But its all that replayable. You can make up scenarios where you have sims only practice a certain type of magic but other than that as seen in most packs, there's no depth. Fun gameplay though.",Recommended
2379,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"This pack is pretty disappointing to me - not because it's buggy or unhelpful, but because the whole thing was not thought out well.

The first thing of note is that the magic system is horribly balanced. I can't stress that enough. The first spells you're likely to learn are some of the best ones on offer. The first Mischief spell you'll get is pointless (though most of the spells in that school are more for roleplay purposes than actual use), and pretty suitable for baby's first spell - making another sim sad is the kind of silly, inconsequential effect you'd expect as a tutorial, right? Well, the first Untamed spell lets you burn down somebody's house. The first Practical spells let you completely ignore Hygiene and the Repair skill. And the first potion recipe you'll get tops out all of your needs for the price of a single apple, which you can find growing wild in most neighborhoods. You get four of these for one apple. I'm not saying it was impossible before this to have a sim that could just fish all day, but it took over 30,000 lifetime aspiration points to do that. You can make a new spellcaster, move them into an empty lot with an apple tree and a cauldron, and they won't need anything else to exist.

And it's not really uphill from there. There's some cool later-on spells, like teleportation or spawning food or immunity to aging, but most of the magic tree is clutter - potions that make negative interactions stronger, spells that give other sims bad moodlets, spells that tidy up a single plant in your garden. One master-level spell lets you teleport back to the Magic Realm, which is completely useless because spellcasters start out with an inventory item that already does that. And then you have a few more balance breakers, like duplicating items or bringing sims back to life (which is something you could already do, but the spell replaces a long writing aspiration journey or a top level cooking recipe with rare ingredients with a simple click of a button, and that's kind of the flavor of the whole pack.)

You also get a free copy of a potion when you read its potion book, which gets downright silly when it comes to one-offs like the Potion of Immortality. You never actually need to hunt down ingredients - just learn the recipe and bam, you're immortal. Whenever one of my low-level spellcasters get cursed, I just get a spellcaster who hasn't already read the tome of Curse Cleansing to read it and pass my sim the free potion. I almost never have to actually brew potions, which... is supposed to be the reason potions aren't spells? I think? It doesn't seem like this is the way the game was meant to be played, but again - this pack just makes everything in it way too easy.

The charge system is built up as a risk/reward, but it doesn't function well as either; the power increase doesn't affect most spells you'll actually use (you can't really improve instant effects like duplicating an object, teleporting, or object repair), and you more or less have to be deliberately trying to kill your sim to actually die from the risk factor. It almost never seems to actually kill you the first time you max out charge, firing a warning shot at you instead, it's hard to actually max charge without getting nonlethally blown up and reset to 0 in that 66-99% range, and if that wasn't easy enough, the progression tree immediately unlocks a perk that lets you drop your charge on will, allowing you to continue to cast as many spells as you want. Curses end up being scarier than death, and curses are just nuisances that you can't do anything about until you reach a certain spellcaster level, whereupon you can instantly get rid of them for free and they functionally stop existing. But they're at least something.

This is all pretty slapdash compared to the Vampires dlc, which has a similar progression and level system, except the stuff you learn at first is weaker than the cool stuff you get later, the really strong and game-changing stuff is at the top of the tree, and the risks and penalties involved with the life state don't make it a no-brainer for every single sim you play.

The Magic Realm itself looks incredible, but like the rest of the pack, it's very style over substance - a big, flashy space that has very little actual stuff to do in it. Duels sound cool until you realize it's just the same animation with no input or variance depending on what spells the sims know. Wands are completely aesthetic; brooms and familiars are only the barest step above that and have no interactive features. Learning magic boils down to a very brief fetch quest, then coming back every few hours and asking three NPCs for a spell and recipe until you eventually have them all. You might have to come back even more times to collect all wands and familiars, but they're all functionally interchangeable. (If you have Cats and Dogs, there's at least a level of interest in being able to bind an existing pet as a familiar, and they have slightly more functionality there.) And even though it's already been established that there's basically no need to ever obtain potion ingredients - even if there was, there's no trouble obtaining them either because they're all on sale at the Magic Realm too. Which is a shame, because the time you had to spend combing the world for rare collectibles tempered both the powerful effects and the moneymaking potential in Sims 3 version of magic - and speaking of which, the Magic Realm just lets you buy certain complex harvestables like dragonfruit and death flowers that will break any sense of progression for a new family, spellcaster or not. You can show up to Glimmerbrook, pay 1k for an item to plant, and then earn thousands a day and functional immortality without ever having to join a career or anything.

It's just not very well thought-out, and the whole thing is a bit painful because you can really see a potential that wasn't carried through. The bones of something awesome are here, but only the art department put in any legwork. Which is... sadly kind of expected for the Sims 4.

It's a great pack if you like playing with cheats but feel like hitting ctrl-c is too much effort. And it's alright if you just want to roleplay your sims as witches and wizards. But if you like game balance and having to work for your goodies, this probably isn't the pack for you.",Not Recommended

2382,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"Harry Potter comes to the Sims, without the Harry Potter license. Sounds great. But it is appallingly badly done, given the price.

So yes, you travel to a special magic place (not technically a school, but you go there to learn), where you seek out a street that isn't called Diagon Alley but where you buy your wands and bits and bobs for doing your wizarding... but then you swiftly realise how pointless it all is.

You can choose between lots of broomsticks, but they all do the same simple thing (let you move around the map faster), you can choose between lots of familiars but they have no interactions or interest (they all just tweak a skill-increase rate in exactly the same way), you can have magical duels (which visually exactly copy the Harry/Voldemort duel in the movies) but they are pointlessly random, you can collect potion ingredients but they all swiftly become unnecessary (once you have the Copypasto spell), you can choose between lots of wands but none of them do anything at all... etc. The game tells you that there are multiple types of magic and asks you which you'll learn, but the answer is that you'll learn all three of them, since learning spells is so stupidly simple that the game then has to throw a lot of grindy, repetitive interactions at you to slow down how fast you can learn the one magic skill/rank; and when you've learned the spells you'll wonder why you bothered, as most are pointless (except Copypasto, which is insanely overpowered and feels like a cheat).

Imagine all the things they could have done with this! They could have had different skills (potions, defence against the dark arts, etc.) with challenges to upgrade them (like magical careers). They could have had separate supporting skills (like broomstick flying, or magical gardening). They could have had magic depend on other skills (so you'd want to level up other stuff to hone your sorcerer). They could have had different paths (ritual magic, practical magic, techno-magic, etc.). They could have had rivalries between Houses. And more.... Yet they actually did none of these. Zero.

There was so much potential. But what they actually did was repetitive, unimaginative, and with no choice or variety.

Having said that, the Magical Realm is beautiful, and if you want a bit of a Harry Potter homage in your Sims then sure, this is your way in. So if magic appeals to you then maybe buy this on sale.

2385,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"For context, I sincerely enjoy The Sims 4, even as a fan of The Sims 3. All DLC I own was bought on sale, save for a few stuff packs.

Realm of Magic is a bit of a mixed bag, admittedly. At the end of the day I recommend it, but only just barely. Compared to other packs, it comes up short. What saves it is the utility of the pack, the create-a-sim items, and build items. Overall I find the magic system a bit bland, the familiars a great idea but ultimately useless, buggy, and disappointing, and the progression is very ehhhhhhhhhhhh. Some of the features, such as duels, are also somewhat pointless and a bit difficult to set up. I also found it deeply disappointing that being able to use magic requires a specific life state. Not anyone can learn it, you have to choose an interaction and become a spellcaster. Then and only then can you use magic. I was hoping to combine this with vampirism to create a powerful vampire mage type of sim, but no such luck. One or the other.

PROS:

- New world, Glimmerbrook. Very pretty

- New location, the Magic Realm, where you can find a sort of school where magic practicing sims spend their time. You can find NPCs that can make you spellcaster, stores that sell alchemy ingredients, familiars, and other items

- Familiars, which are essentially tiny companions

- Spells have LOTS of utility and genuinely affect gameplay, allowing you to teleport, instantly fill your hygiene bar, instantly creating high quality meals, fix broken objects, steal items, affect other sims emotions, resurrect a sim, and more.

- TONS of create-a-sim items that have plenty of extra applications outside of spellcasters. Some easily blend in with gothic, punk, cottagecore, or posh vibes, be it clothes, hair, or makeup. High quality in that respect.

- Spellcasting abilities are hereditary, and spellcaster children inherit bloodlines that affect their magical prowess.

- Balanced gameplay. Use of magic builds up energy that can kill your sims if not vented or left alone for some time. Spells can also backfire and turn into curses that can be genuinely annoying, but are not difficult to get rid off.

CONS:

- Spells are not as interesting as they could be, and basically mostly exist to make things easier.

- Familiars have very little utility, and mostly just flap around or float near you. No interactions with them outside of summoning or dismissing. Disappointing, as they could've had similar functions to a trained pet.

- Magic Realm and Glimmerbrook as a whole are relatively small and hold few if any secrets. Glimmerbrook is especially underwhelming, as it has few lots and most are inhabited.

- A bit buggy, especially where familiars are concerned.

- Spellcaster is a life state, and in order to become one you must seek out a sage. This is not explained or tutorialized. Rather than magic just being another skill, you have to enter the life state. So you cannot have magic as a vampire outside of your vampire powers. This is limiting, though understandable for balancing. Just disappointing.

Overall, I only just barely recommend Realm of Magic, and definitely only on sale. The quality and amount of content is just not there enough for it to justify $20.",Recommended
2386,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"I'm honestly surprised people don't like this pack. Yes, the price is way to much, but this is sadly EA.

First of all, lets talk about the non-magic stuff. I love the outfits and things to add to your house. The Wands and brooms are also pretty. I love the Q&A shelf. If you just want things to make your sims look better, you might actual want to get this pack.

Now, the magic.

Personalty, i wish there were more spells. However, i do enjoy the ones you have. Have an annyiong naboir? Set them on fire, or just daze them and make them leave the house. Or force them to clean the house. (this is really handy for me because i have a full house of cats with my main sim.) Don't want to brother with collectible searching? Copypasto's got you covered. Want to be a kleptomaniac sim without being one? They got that too. (And its even better then the trait.) Is your sim refusing to clean a puddle on the grass? Not anymore.

The potions are also pretty good. I only use Prompt Resurrection, Plentiful Needs, And Rejuvenation. Due to my sim's trait of being a perfectionist, Plentiful Needs fulles all of them, and its pretty handy for letting me do other things. Rejuvenation replaces potion of Youth.

Leveling up your rank can be a little girndy at times, but personalty, i feel like that's worth it. Its like how working on a skill is. And kept in mind, even with a maxed out spellcaster, it is possible for things to fail. If your not careful and use skills in moderation, you can die from overcharge. And even if you use Prompt Resurrection, you can still die again to this. And again.

You can also have your pets as a familiar if you have Cats and Dogs. Even a ghost pet.

Copypasto many seem a bit broken to some, but there's actually only a few things that this breaks that aren't all ready broken. Time caples and Limestone are the biggest ones, but not everyone likes chance games, and i feel that this isn't dirty. Its also really just these two. You could use Copypasto on something expensive, but to that i say: Have you tried gardening death followers? There are faster ways then Copypasto to make money.

You can use Copypasto on things like rocks, but as far as i'm aware, this does nothing but raise your spellcaster charge. And using Copypasto a lot is a huge charge builder.

Most of the ""breaks"" you could do also have other ways to get the results. Zipzap breaks an item, and you could repair to get parts... or you could just buy them.

The only real issue i have (aside the price, but haha its EA), is how theres a lot they could have done, but didn't. Theirs a lack of content. That being said, i do enjoy what i got. And again, love the stuff for houses added in this.",Recommended

With the introduction of cottage living, you can enjoy the wood-sy aesthetic to the fullest (and the clothes that come with this pack are absolutely adorable even though some of the furniture is a bit too fancy for my taste) so if you're like me and want to feel like a local witch the kids are afraid of, then I think you might enjoy this pack.",Recommended
2394,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"Although I was disappointed by how small The Magic Realm was, I still thoroughly enjoyed this pack. Spellcasters have some really cool abilities. A lot of the spells such as Inferinate and Zipzap feel completely useless, but do not fear, you can install a mod called 'Deadly Spellcasters' to unlock versions of those spells that, pack a bit more of a punch to say the least, as well as some other fun new spells that all esentially achieve the same goal but in different and exciting ways. If you are going to download this pack, I highly recommend you also have Vampires installed and install the 'Occult Hybrid Unlocker' to be a Vampire and a Spellcaster at the same time, just make sure you max out your Vampire abilities first before becoming a Spellcaster. It makes the game so much more fun and gives your Sim access to a whole range of different abilities, very fun pack, especially with mods! The one thing I was very disappointed with though was the duelling, unlike in Vampires, where the results of the duel was based on fitness skill and the Vampiric Might ability, magic duels, at least for me didn't seem to be based on anything. My Sim had the Master Duellist perk at Virtuoso rank and still failed to beat even apprentices in duelling, I tried to install a mod to fix it but it just made it so no one wins the duel. I also would have liked it if one Spellcaster could overpower another and take their magic away, like in Vampires, so overall the duelling was very disappointing. I still very much enjoyed overall though.",Recommended
2395,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"I like the abilities, many of them are very useful for everyday stuff. For example, there's a spell that lets you instantly clean things, grow a good garden, duplicate items, etc. There's a few spells that let you mess with other sims, like you can light them on fire, freeze them, take control of them and have them clean up for you. Being a spellcaster is close to being a vampire, except you're not immortal and you don't have to feed on sims every once in a while. You also don't burn in sunlight or have an alternate form. You have more abilities too, great for any sim personality. The new world is somewhat mediocre, though it is more detailed than Forgotten Hollow from Vampires. You can train with more powerful wizards, and there's a place where you can buy spellbooks and ingredients for potions.

The construction of the interior is a bit better, but it doesn't bring anything new - except for windows and a few other things, it doesn't bring anything else with the basic game. The magical world is surprisingly good, but there is no bed, so the sims have to sleep on benches and the magic itself is good, but the sims learn spells and potions for an incredibly long time and flying on a broom is completely uninteresting and acquaintances just fly over the player, although most one of them is nice, but they are useless - for me this DLC is a big disappointment. 2⭐",Not Recommended

2403,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"Yes, you can say this pack is similar to Vampires. The way you build up your sim to learn magic is somewhat similar. But thats where it ends. The Realm of Magic world is amazing. The graphics are amazing in that world. Unfortunately there's only 4 resident lots and a bar (which you can convert to a resident to make it 5). If you have Seasons, the only thing that pack adds is the activities and rain/storms. The Vintage pack works well with this pack too but tbh, it's better on Vampires. But you didn't buy the pack for that. You bought it to use magic. Yes it's super hilarious when you use magic to make people go crazy especially when crashing a gathering just like Vampires using their supernatural powers.

2406,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"A little magic can take you a long way…

The breathtaking world known as Glimmerbrook gives a lot of fairytale vibes. It may be a small world, but it is still a very detailed world – don’t forget we have the magical realm where you can travel from one floating rock to another without a loading screen.

Not to mention, I totally in love with the familiars that came with this pack. There are a lot of options for them and you can have more than one. They can also travel to other worlds with your Sims and give words of encouragement when learning spells and potions.

The gameplay is a lot of fun from the moment you gain magical abilities. You’ll learn potions and spells and duel other Sims, which could be for fun or to get something in return, or just because you don’t like someone. You can do magic outside of the realm, even travel via broomstick. The spells and potions do practically everything from filling all your needs to prevent yourself from meeting death.

Overall, occupied my life for days straight, and I am still actively playing the Sim I created for this pack on a daily basis. The spells and potions are just so invaluable. I personally loved this pack and would highly recommend you grab it!",Recommended
2407,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"I was one of those people that avoided this pack for the longest time because I wanted my game to be more realistic. I decided to buy it anyways in the end so I could have the complete set. I never expected I would actually thoroughly enjoy this pack.

There is already many things in the sims that is unrealistic anyways. I have to say now that this pack really is worth it in my opinion. It gives you more things to do and enjoy with your favorite sims.

There are some critics out there of course but I'm actually glad this packs not too difficult.

I think most people have used cheats at some point I think and I wouldn't believe anyone that said they never have cheated before. There are some out there maybe but I look at this pack as a way to cheat without actually cheating and it's way more fun because cheating is too easy and not as satisfying. If your someone that dose cheat a lot I think you will appreciate this pack. I can now technically say I don't cheat buy using this alternative way to get something I want a little faster. It's a lot more fun than just straight up cheating.

I enjoyed crafting the potions the most and is by far my most favorite feature and the only part of this pack that I really use. I use the potions from this pack along side my normal game play and less of the actual magic casting because it's a good balance in my opinion without taking the unrealistic magic too far.

I haven't run into any bugs or issues with the pack as of February 2021. They obviously fixed the problems it maybe had before I wrote this review so you don't need to worry about that at this point now.

I'd recommend this pack as more of an end game investment to those that are getting a little tired of repetitive skill building who want to play without cheating. So I say buy it... Let loose a little and try something different. I don't think you'll regret it.

And for closing I just wanted to say i'm very happy EA decided for whatever reason to add this pack & the rest of the Sims 4 collection to Steam. I never had an issue using any of the packs with my Steam purchase of The Sims 4. I don't think I would have made the huge investment if they didn't add it to Steam. I really like how organized and easy it was to purchase this pack to go with my game.",Recommended
2408,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"Out of the game packs, Realm of Magic is tied with Vampires for my favorite. Spellcasters and Vampires are incredibly robust, and I absolutely love filling my games with Spellcasters - If I'm making new Sims, and a Sim isn't destined for another life state, they're probably going to be a spellcaster!
Spellcasters can change your gameplay as much or as little as you focus on building up their magic. (Unlike Vampires, that will fundamentally alter play immediately for Sims age teen and up.) If you focus on spellcasting, your Sim will live a very different life than other Sims.",Recommended
2409,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"The primary reason I bought this expansion is because it boasts the third in game method to suspend aging on your sims, the first two being the life states ghost and vampire. Unfortunately, several hours of grinding afterwards I have discovered that the trait granting this effect is very bugged. It will suspend aging temporarily if you use another effect to reset your age, but once it starts ticking again for one of apparently infinite possible reasons including exiting the game, it will resume ticking until you reset the age again or the sim dies (includes old age death).

So in the end I don't have the effect that I want, and I have dozens of options to trivialize any other type of difficulty in the game. Every other cheat in the game save for suspending aging seems to exist as some sort of spell or potion, making this ultimately an expansion for people who want to use cheats but don't know how to use the debug console.

For people looking for this specific effect to keep some but not all members of your neighborhood around, I'd recommend looking at Strangerville, which can make sims into the best ghosts, or Vampires, which offers a smaller subset of cheats and will ultimately leave you with a game to still play.",Not Recommended

Honestly if this were not on sale, I personally would have never bothered to try it, but to be straight the main reasons I cannot recommend this DLC even on sale is that the map is incredibly small, the items added are limited and truly fit one theme, the magic aspect is quiet boring and lacks detail.
The world itself is split into two parts, a more earthy one with a few residential lots and one you can travel to via portals in game. The portals (Loading screens really) take you to a series of floating islands in space with omniscient background sounds like Skyrim. Honestly, it feels like a Harry Potter mashup and each island you can travel to via other portals but there is only one enterable building. The rest are empty shells and the world generally is under populated. It takes about 5 minutes to explore the entire Magic Kingdom.
If you like wizards and witchery this is of course the only DLC catered to you but compared to Sims 3 where I almost always made my sim a witch, this DLC is not fun or versatile in what you can do.",Not Recommended
2413,Realm_of_Magic 리뷰,"It's a disappointment.

- Leveling the rank of your spellcaster is a grind because the rewards are unsatisfying. Most of the spells are utterly useless. The only useful spells are in the practical school of magic like Repairio, Herbio, and Copypasto. The last spell is completely broken and feels like a cheat.
- There isn't anything interesting to do in the Magic Realm.
- Dueling is completely broken. Unlike vampire spars which are affected by your perks, fitness level, and vampire rank, the result of spellcaster duels are completely random. Virtuoso spellcasters with the Master Duelist perk will still find themselves losing against apprentices.
- Magical bloodline is badly implemented. They should have just let Sims with magical bloodlines start off at a higher spellcaster rank and know a number of spells.
- Alchemy is part of a spellcaster's abilities, unlike in Sims 3 where it was a standalone skill.

- A potential for limitless powah!!!!!
- Numerous spells to engulf, enslave, and enrage your townies.
- Duel for glory, knowledge, and resources.
- Spells of convenience to replace your repair, gardening, and more - to a degree.
- Like potions that give your sim everything it could need, love potions to get frisky, or settle old rivalries?
- Pass your magical talent from one generation to the next, growing over time.
- THIS IS MAH BROOMSTICK
- Cheat death in a few ways.
- And more!

With multiple ways to cheat death from decorating your house as well as resurrecting the dead, with a few talented spellslingers your clan or character can survive anything.

One of only few game packs with great replayability value and not too hostile towards other expansion packs (except Vampires). This pack introduces a new ""near open world"" world that your sims could free roam around the entire area with only loading screen happening when changing lots, and by far the biggest one of all game packs with single world fabric. Good in-game lore that isn't linear or force you to get into. New occult sim (obviously) with good range of customisation capabilities. Fun werewolf quirks to navigate around and build up story or new challenges. Werewolf rivals with interesting backstory. Good build and debug items that aren't too tacky to use. Overall, as long as you grab it on sale, you won't gonna be too much disappointed.

There are downsides in this pack. First, there are persistent bugs that glitch out werewolf sim if you load it from gallery, sometimes its texture goes black and cannot be recovered easily. You can workaround it by adding extra paint into its fur and that pretty much fixes it. Second, certain accessory types and CAS items are not compatible with werewolves, notably, shoes and socks (they always walk bare feet). Mods cannot fix it or your werewolf sim will always wear shoes including when it takes a bath/shower. To convert shoes and socks to become compatible with werewolves, use Sims 4 Studio, but it will convert those items into Custom Contents and you use them that way. Don't forget CASUnlocks mod. Werewolf toenail may clip out socks, be aware of that. For more, there are few content creators making werewolf CCs and mods around. You can go and check them out.",Recommended

2434,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"I mean the general idea of the concept is good, I just don't like the way they did it. Especially the models. 1 they literally look like furries. Skip that.. It's not even that the werewolf models look rather wrong. I wish they just made them look like an actual wolf. Like just make them a wolf instead of whatever these abominations are.. Or even better, make two different models, one that's just a wolf (Which werewolves are actually supposed to look like...) and one that looks rather humanoid (Basically these current models but less creepy and more appealing.) And what I noticed from most of the man races (like mermaid, Vampire, Werewolf, etc.) They need more unique stuff that you can do when they are children/toddlers. I know they already have a ""howl"" thingy but that does nothing. Let's be real, it's just howling. Anyone can do it. So maybe an idea could be that similar to the adult werewolves they can turn into wolf puppies? But they don't really have self control hence how young they are so you can give them and make them act like the same way of a puppy. (Destroying furniture, etc.) Honestly this game pack is useless, because it really isn't that good. Even the mermaid and vampire game packs are better than this one. At least they have more gimmicks, and their models aren't crap. I just wish they were more creative on this game pack. Literally all you cold do is howl, turn into whatever these abominations are and that's pretty much it. I wouldn't recommend this if you are expecting good models and more gimmicks. Literally there's only like 3 or 4 gimmicks. But the least they could do is remodel the ""werewolves"" please. THEY LOOK HORRIBLE.. CREEPY EVEN! Make the models look like an actual wolf and maybe even cute. But please also add puppy models for toddlers, Kids, etc. Oh, And one other thing, They need to add more feminine wolf models.

Bella: I've held her once! One time, Jacob! And already you think that you have some moronic wolfy claim on her? She's mine!

Jacob: It's fine, Leah.

Bella: You're gonna stay away from her.

Jacob: You know I can't do that.

Esme: Stop her, Edward.

Edward: He said it's fine. She's amazing, right?

Jacob: Do you remember how much you wanted to be around me 3 days ago? That's gone now, right?

Bella: Long gone.

2438,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"It's hard to recommend any of the packs for The Sims 4 as I a firmly against microtransations and DLC to the extent the sims 4 has but I did enjoy this pack, specifically the build/buy side of it as I am more of a CAS/Build player, I don't think it's worth the full price though and would recommend getting it on sale, which EA often puts it on sale especially during holiday seasons, or get it in a bundle, Lilsimsie has full reviews of what each pack has in it, as gameplay mechanics are often not really described in the pack's description",Recommended
2439,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"Played this for a few hours and here is my initial reaction:
Basically furry update. The perks are somewhat interesting and basically eliminate the needs for most items that fill basic needs like energy, bladder, hygiene, and hunger. Ranking up is pretty easy, just do werewolf actions. The werewolves look good unlike in the Sims 3 but, still no tail unfortunately. You can fully customize fur pattern. Great pack for furry trash like me. Also after your first transformation you can stay in wolf form without being on a rampage which increases skill gains but makes fury gains happen more often.
One annoying part is most of the werewolf temperaments are awful. The anti-capitalist temperament basically makes it impossible to get promoted. You got to work for a few hours and then your fury fills and you leave to rampage. And when you're done you can't go back to work for the day. There's a ton of others that make you gain fury from watching TV or the stereo, hate water, etc. It seems they're largely random but they are influenced by certain actions like eating lots of meat will cause the carnivore trait. There are over 20 temperaments and only 4 are good. I'd recommend using cheats to remove the bad ones and just add the 4 good ones if just to prevent the negative ones that really limit your sim's ability to improve themselves. Although I've found the removing traits cheat seems to fail sometimes.
The new town is small but, I've heard you can unlock more areas through the town quest.
All in all probably one of the few packs worth getting. I'd recommend getting it on sale. However, it's kinda crappy that they didn't just put all occult forms in one pack.",Recommended

2444,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"Seems alright so far. It's a werewolf pack.. Not much more to it than that. You get various perks from living as a werewolf and you can ""rank up"" your wolf level over time. But my biggest gripe is that the world that comes with this pack (Moonwood Mill) is absolutely freaking TINY.. It only has five lots in total. One bar (50x40), one library (40x30) one empty residential lot (30x30), one unowned residential lot with a house (20x15), and one owned residential lot with a house. (40x30) That means there's literally only one resident family in this world, making it feel even tinier than it looks if you're looking for locals to interact with, unless you stuff every lot with as many sims as you can or something. I recommend getting this on the best sale you can get if you still want it.
SIDE NODE: There's a weird issue with making werewolves in CAS where changing the faces/bodies of the wolves will directly effect and change the normal sim form. This is.. weird, since other occult sims are not like this at all and it can result in your regular sim looking SUPER weird when all you were trying to do was give your wolf a bigger snout or smaller eyes. Idfk if this was intentional on EA's part, but I hate it. (Edit: You have to unlink features from matching. Which was definitely not obvious and easy to miss.)",Recommended

You can change cheek fluff, chin fluff, head shape, eyes/eye color (purples, pinks, greens and more colors), and you can change nose colors. For werewolf ears, there are options for left/right/both bitten off, left/right/both floppy, pointy, and normal. Your werewolves can wear clothes, and have accessories too, though they can't wear shoes. For humans, it comes with mullets (like every pack), colorful mullets, under cuts (+one with a crescent moon), and a colorful version of that. Overall, i highly recommend this pack.

2463,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"Of all the sims packs I've seen, this is the only one that's well-rated, and I can see why.
The Werewolves are the best, and most fleshed-out Occult Sim in the game. The added werewolves-based world may look like a tiny little area, but the real fun isn't in the lots, it's in the world itself. With several little areas like sparring grounds, wolf-pack hangouts, and even a fake house for the mysterious Greg.
Other versions of Werewolves in the sims have always looked goofy and weird, even the one on the picture for this pack, but in the game they're actually really cute. The werewolves can also be intimidating if you do it right.
The werewolves pack is amazing if you like lore, not just for Werewolves, but also some Vampire and Spellcaster lore as well.
On top of all this, the build mode elements are amazing, especially if you like rustic and worn looking things.
People tend to say that it's invasive to the rest of the world, and if you download this you won't be able to play without werewolves., but I honestly haven't seen a single rampaging werewolf outside of the Moonwood Mill area.

There is a lot of improvement compared to previous sims werewolves, but yet, it still is missing ""something"". Likely the best DLC for sims 4 though.

2476,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"This is the best iteration of Werewolves in the Sims series, and has been a wonderful experience. However, it is not flawless. Compared to other Game Packs, I will rate Werewolves as high priority pack if you like Supernatural / Occult Sims, however it is behind Realm of Magic and Vampires because it has more inherent glitches.

For the positives!
The Werewolf ability tree is incredible, and a solid improvement over the Vampire tree. Leveling up as a werewolf feels very natural. The abilities are fun, and impressively well themed to werewolves. It has a repeating top level trait to turn excess points into satisfaction points so your points never become worthless. The wolf temperaments (drawbacks, like vampire weaknesses) work a bit like Spellcasters' curses, and can eventually be turned into strong buffs instead of negatives.
Werewolf toddlers and children can howl, which is THE CUTEST!! The social aspects of being a werewolf are well integrated to feel very natural, while making it a very important part of being a werewolf. Even if you do not have your werewolf join one of the wolf packs, it does feel aptly important for your wolf to have and interact with friends and family. Werewolf families are possibly the most wholesome thing in this game - and Sims is not short on feel good, wholesome features.

And the bad news...
The werewolf packs (Wildfangs and Moonwood Collective) do not repopulate if the NPCs in them die, and can become broken if this happens. The wolf packs are also exceedingly repetitive in gameplay, so while the first time through one is fun, it is tedious to stay in one for a long game or to play with them again with other Sims. They also have no options to make them less demanding, or even tailored to what you would prefer at all. It is difficult to ignore the packs entirely, because some of the very helpful wolf traits are tied to the wolf packs.
Werewolves have a ""Fated Mate"" system, that selects one semi-random other werewolf as the ""destined"" romantic partner for that Sim. Doing any romantic interaction from that point on with ANY Sim other than the one designated other Sim, will give your Sim a massive Tense debuff that lasts quite a while. A Fated Mate can not be removed once set through gameplay, and cheats can fail to remove it as well. The only way to reliably remove it is with mods, and it is still a huge hassle. The Fated Mate can trigger VERY inappropriately, on toddlers, elders, family members, and does not respect Sim gender/romance preferences at all. EA has been struggling to correct this, and has partially patched it (especially concerning toddlers), but mostly they have just been struggling as this is still happening.
Speaking of toddlers, exporting a werewolf toddler (to the gallery or saving them to your library) is extremely buggy. They will not show up in the preview, and if you click on their individual preview the game will 100% of the time error out and need to be force quit. You do not get to save first. They do export (and import elsewhere) fine, but you can not select them in the preview. The response from EA about this bug has been underwhelming, a fix feels unlikely at the time of writing this.
Last, and imo least, the werewolf form design has been heavily criticized by a lot of people. I do not find it off putting like the Sims 2 or Sims 3 ugly werewolves, however my screenshots of these werewolves sent to friends who do not play Sims are invariably met the first time with an inquiry about at best the ""Cat Person"" or worst the ""Furry"". (And they are overwhelmingly towards the worst end of that.) While I think the design isn't too bad, almost no one else that I know likes it.",Recommended

Supernatural pack was like, werewolf, vampires, fairies, mages and a metric tonne of cool spooky stuff at a reasonable collective package, but now everything is stripped down individually to raep your wallet.

Unless you get some INSANE sale, find some resellers, EA stops being stupid or you straight up find a torrent, do not buy this stuff at full price, these are exploitative whale rates and EA knows EXACTLY what they're doing to you, lol.

The Sims 4 werewolves is a pack I'd recommend to a person who’s new to the Sims. The pack actually has flavor and is one of less buggy packs. There’s also lore hidden within the pack which is pretty cool. Not to mention that this pack actually added body scars. If you’re a user who likes a rundown theme in the Sims then this is a pack for you. Most of the build mode items are designed to look busted. This pack also introduces a new world, although it only has five lots and more than half are being used. I did hear that was because of the budget.

I must admit that some of the clothes are a little weird to try to put on the wolf form, but it's possible to make it work with a few carefully picked outfits.

I like the paint feature and that you can make the wolf form's outfits match like the human form. I like what they've done with them and even though the map is small that it still maintains it's own overarching story line without it being one and done like strangerville. I also like the different abilities you can get and I love how much detail went into all of the pack.

Reading the tooltips and item descriptions show a lot of care and detail was made here, things I at least really appreciate. (Fenry Chompsalot Jr. is precious and must be protected. Fight me.) I love the style and theme of Moonwood Mill, the other sims are quite neat and interesting while matching the setting quite effectively.

Unexpectedly good.",Recommended
2536,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"Does exactly what you think it would, adds werewolves and a few other little things to the game. I'd prefer my werewolves be a little more movie monster like and a bit less furry/anthro like, but I'm glad to have them back anyways. The new neighborhood is nice, but just as small but weirdly hard to navigate at the other SIMs4 neighborhoods (you'd think EA would have improved this, but they actually made it worse, by adding fog).

I recommend this if you like werewolves (or furries/anthros) and have twenty bucks to spare.",Recommended
2537,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"I like this pack! The only thing I have an issue with is the wolf model. Very uncanny valley vibes I can't lie; why has it got no tail? and why do the legs look like that? Like, I can sort of forgive the tail bit, but the legs are just strange to look at. Other than that, I wish we (players) could make our own wolf packs, that would be awesome, I mean it would totally make sense too. I'm gonna assume that feature along with a few others will be sold as an add-on perhaps..? If not I'll just wait for a mod to inevitably turn up.",Recommended
2538,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"I am enjoying the DLC. This dlc has potential, so please listen to your fans EA. Tails, more building spots, make own Pack, if one Sim becomes part of a Pack then the rest of your Sim family should be included. Not a fan of having to individually gain the Pack Leader's trust. If you become Alpha, there should be an option for your mate to get the title of Luna. Maybe more in depth hideouts would be good. Definitely just do more research on lycan and werewolf lore and take from it.",Recommended
2539,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"I gotta hand it to ea I was very surprised by how GOOD this pack was, The amount of detail and gameplay makes this absolutely worth the money. For instance Vampires and Werewolves upon first meeting eachother already dislike one another, this makes for such great gameplay! (also vampires don't like drinking from werewolves cause it tastes like dog water.. literally) the only con I have is I wish there were more clothing for children and or toddlers, but other then that 10/10 best occult pack!",Recommended
2540,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"As far as Sims 4 packs go, this is the least offensive. Great Build/Buy, pretty great CAS (although lacking for men again), and a cool new life state that has skills and somehow impacts gameplay decently enough (albeit the human legs are... odd). If you have $20 or want to wait for a sale, then I'd put this on the priority list.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but the Sims 4 Werewolves are the best werewolves in the series. My friends know I'm a Sims 1 stan and I have to give credit to the Sims 4 Werewolves for being the best the series has seen.",Recommended

2542,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"Pretty good DLC, its not even an expansion which is surprising. This is just as big as some of the expansions. Being a were wolf is more of a challenge, and changes priorities... Is this a bad thing? Actually, a very good thing. I want more variety and crazy stuff happening in sims and then adapting to each change that you may not have control over.

This DLC does that for me.",Recommended
2543,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"I feel like a lot of the anti-furries blindly downvote the werewolves in this game, just because the designs of the werewolves are too furry-like.

Personally I think their designs aren't bad, not amazing, but still good enough and a huge improvement to the Sims 3 werewolves.

Gameplay wise, at first the werewolves are gonna be a huge hassle, but it does add this RPG-like mechanic and gameplay loop to it. Eventually the further werewolves ""Levels up"" it gets easier to control and gets some fun abilities.

I still want to play more and see more possibilities the werewolves can do, so right now I'll recommend this game pack for all the furries and werewolf lovers out there.",Recommended

2545,늑대인간 게임팩 리뷰,"What can i say about this DLC.
So far, you can only join a pack pre made not create your own however you are able to take over it but it takes alot of work raising your skills as a werewolf.
To create the wolf b gone cure is tedius as you need an item thats only available in one obscure area of the map at a certain moon type.
There is of course a way to transform yourself from mortal to werewolf but they also added a disease with this dlc.
The constant need to keep reputation up is irritable when your sims are the bread winner of the household.
The destruction to homes when enraged is costly to repair or replace the over all style of wolf is hideous and simply i find the dlc not worth the money.",Not Recommended

It literally makes your game crash when you enter a restaurant, and even if you do by some luck, your sims won't sit down and the food they order only comes 10% of the time. I was only able to make it work moderately (moderately meaning not making my game crash upon entering a restaurant lot and food coming to my table maybe 15% of the time instead of 10) with 2 mods that have to be updated every time EA patches the game which is once every 2 weeks and sometimes more because every update introduces new bugs.",Not Recommended
2569,Dine_Out 리뷰,"I would highly suggest having the 'Get to Work' expansion pack before purchasing this game pack, otherwise is does become rather bland. If you have the expansion pack I mentioned above, then I would say this is an amazing pack to incorporate into your game play.

You can plan dates and have your sims actually able to go into a restaurant or cafe, speak to a host, and even order a five course meal if they are so inclined to do so. The game pack adds a more interactive work life and romantic life.

I have a vast majority of my sims own restaurants or cafes. You can do a lot with story lines such as creating chains in each of your sim worlds, or having your sim start off in the culinary career, reaching their full potential, and saving up enough money to start a small business that can grow into a family legacy (or disaster). It's super cool to decorate and customize.

The one issue I do have with the pack is the fact that your sim can't actually preform any of the work duties. Your sim can clear a table, check in on tables, pay to train their employees, and even customize their locations. However, despite all of those great aspects of the pack, your sim can't act as a host or even cook any of the meals which is a big disappointment. I would have loved to have a sim come out of the culinary career and later act as a chef at the restaurant they manage, but they are only able to manage, they can't at all interact with chef or host stations.

I played for about 3 hours until I realized the mod never loaded. So I had been playing just the pack for hours and had no issues. My business was making money, people were eating and leaving, the host was seating people, the waiter did their jobs just fine, everything was just FINE. I would say the ONLY thing is the chefs do take forever to cook lol But other than that, I don't remember ever getting frustrated with the game play. That being said, I did eventually redownload Carls mod until it worked and the mod does make it a little more fun. It gives extra settings the pack alone does not like giving your host the option to just great the guest, not leave the host stand and walk them to the seat.

2587,Dine_Out 리뷰,"I'm surprised to see that I'm one of the few who love this pack. Yes, it does have some bugs but I still enjoy playing this.

This game is about your sim being the owner of a restaurant. You use your funds to build up a restaurant, create a menu, attire for your staff, hire them, and finally open the place up. You then run the place to make sure your staff provides excellence service, your customers are pleased, train your staff, and make the restaurant one of the very best.

I feel like this pack and many of the Sims packs should get a new update. This is surprisingly one of the worsts packs reviewed on Steam, but I seem to be one of the few who enjoy it. I think it's because people expect more from this pack like becoming the chef of your restaurant, which I feel like it should be added in a future update if the developers ever get to updating any of their packs.

Overall if you like running a restaurant or just being creative with building lots, this is the game for you. It takes time to create the perfect restaurant in-game, but it will be worth it.

2623,Dine_Out 리뷰,"Five star restaurant owner working as janitor is so fun

Dine Out is a dlc which adds restaurants and some other cooking related stuff. For what it is it should be a part of another dlc. Don't get me wrong, it adds a lot to the game. Managing your own restaurant is really fun.
You can create the menu from a long list of foods which means your restaurant can be themed, like Italian one or some cheap diner, it's up to you.

You can design worker uniforms and you'll need at least 3 workers. Chef - who prepares food and food quality depends on his/her skill. If your chef improves he can make more complicated dishes. You can pay for training so his skills would improve. Same applies to the waiter and...forgot how it's called, the person who welcomes customers.
They all do their job pretty well although waiter sometimes starts shoveling snow or cleaning toilets. But wait! She washes her hands after that! Of course you can help them so it's better if you do all the cleaning stuff. How come you can't hire a janitor? So basically you the owner of this business are working as janitor. But you can do other stuff, like welcome customers, check on tables, recommend a dish, etc.

You can build your restaurant from grounds up. Design anything, the building, walls, roofs, put decorations and signs, in other words it's up to your imagination.

Just like with retail stores you earn perk points which you can spend on making your restaurant more efficient and bring in more profits. I must say at least at the beggining your profits are really tiny.
You also earn stars depending on how customers rated your place. Workers can demand better pay or training which adds some complexity to the system too.

You can also go to a restaurant alone or with your friends or family now. Check the menu and pick the dishes you want. Which adds another fun activity.

Besides all that it adds a bunch of items as usual, many of those obviously are restaurant or food related.

It's a good dlc if you want something different from retail stores and i recommend it. Although in my opinion it should be included with ""Get to Work"" dlc. If you think you want it, buy it in a bundle only when on sale.",Recommended
2624,Dine_Out 리뷰,"A little bit buggy sometimes like customer standing and walking around instead of waiting in one place, but I can pretend it like they walking around to meet their friend and have a small talk then later they come back to their seat to enjoy the food.

You can run a restaurant like a manager only, but if you want to let your sim doing the job like chef, waitress, host, you can install a mod called ""Hire certain Sims (incl. Family Members) at Restaurants"" (from LittleMsSam's Sims 4 Mods). This mod will make a whole family of your sim working in the restaurant and you can also don't need to pay for your family member due to it's a family restaurant. Currently with this mod I'm running a small ramen restaurant with my sim family in Snowy Escape pack.",Recommended
2625,Dine_Out 리뷰,"I'm just not thrilled with this pack. I haven't played with the restaurants extensively, but the ones I have are so overwhelmingly dull that it's hard to find the motivation to dive into them as much as I do most other Sims content. Since you are forced to only be the ""Owner"" role, there's very poor interactions with running your restaurant. Your sims can not be the chef, waiter, nor host roles, these must be NPCs. This leaves your Sim to float around awkwardly just welcoming people to the place, interrupting your employees doing their job to praise/reprimand them, and comp meals for angry guests. I guess you can be the janitor and clean...? *Joy.*

The Build / Buy and CAS items are pretty nice, but also fairly specific to, well, restaurants. I've gotten a little use out of some of it otherwise, but it is not a very notable addition to my game.

This was one of the very last packs I bought (as of writing, I currently have all packs [no kits] - I will ofc buy more in the future as more are released), and I definitely recommend that if you do add Dine Out to your collection that it be the LAST game/expansion pack you pick up. Like, really, I enjoyed the other generally poorly rated packs like Batuu and Moschino more than this one.

Side note: Before buying this pack, I had heard about when it was released dining would take an unreasonably long time - in the ballpark of *seven hours* - to complete a meal. I didn't find too many updates about that, just some offhand comments, but it does currently seem to function better than that for me. Guests were staying ~2-3hrs, which isn't unreasonable. I haven't had a large restaurant though, so it may perform worse if you do.",Not Recommended
2626,Dine_Out 리뷰,"Out of all the game packs this is definitely one of the worst, its good to take your sims out to a restaurant but owning a restaurant is not the funnest thing. Your household can't participate in the cooking part and I really wanted to own a family restaurant that has been passed down from generation to generation. It doesn't add much to overall game play and is boring, you would be better of buying another game pack.",Not Recommended
2627,Dine_Out 리뷰,"Virtually Run A Restaurant – Adding Some Business Simulation Spices Into Your Usual Sims Life

The Sims™ 4 Dine Out offers two ways where you can enjoy the new Restaurant Venue; either by visiting them as a customer or by running them for yourself. Your experience when visiting the Restaurant will vary drastically depending on the reason for your visit.

The pack also had a slight update in term of Social Events and Dates, for example: when my Sim went on a date with her love interest in a restaurant, the Date Goals had been updated with specific goals such as getting a table, ordering food and talking about the food. It is little touches like these that makes dining out more than just sending your Sim off somewhere to eat. It is seamlessly integrated into the main game itself and feels like it has always been there.

If your Sim enjoyed the meal, you could even able to ask the Waiter or speak directly to the Chef to let them know that the meal was exquisite. Similarly, you could also complain if the foods are poor to your taste. Sims are able to get food poisoning from poor quality dishes, which your Sims could complained and received the money back.

As an owner, you have the ability to run your very own Restaurant. The customers will give rating after their meals. The rating is mainly based on the environment ambiances, the services your staffs provided, quality of foods and most importantly, the duration of the foods are served. There is also a Restaurant Critique who occasionally shows up. Other than a fancy Star above their head and occasionally whipping out a notepad and pen, I don't see how they will affect the rating of the restaurant.

Sims who have a Cooking Skill level of 5 or higher gain the ability to “study” the new Experimental Food options while dining out at a restaurant. Once eaten they unlock this food to make at home on the new Chef Station. Your Sim can also take pictures of these dishes with their phones and hang the photos on a wall. These pictures also count towards a new Collection in the game, so get your Sims eating and get snapping!!

I know it does not seem like we are getting a lot of new things with this Game Pack, but I do hope that people will realize that the development team have clearly listened to the feedback from fans who weren’t too happy with the Retail System from , and spent more time in getting the gameplay features to work efficiently instead of just throwing new items our way.

For a Game Pack, has a quality where you could easily mistook it for an Expansion Pack. Personally, I feel that this pack is extremely worth it. I quite enjoy the challenge presented by running a restaurant. It is a system which you can’t cheat easily for it to be successful and I am glad of that.",Recommended

2645,피트니스 아이템팩 리뷰,"Most of my sims like fitness that’s why I bought this pack.

✅This pack is well combined with the Snowy Escape pack. The rock wall helps increase your mountain climbing skill. I love it so that I don’t have to go to Mt. Komorebi every time.

✅I love the earbuds so much. If you have the University pack, it helps your sims to have a good mood/fun while doing their homework.

✅The CAS is awesome, especially for male sims. I use them a lot in my game.

✅I love the aesthetics of the build items. They are modern, and it suits my taste well.

❌I know it’s a stuff pack, but it feels like a kit. The content is lacking. I hope there are different varieties of thread mills, more types of gym equipment, and more CAS.

❌There aren’t punching bags!

Overall, it’s a good stuff pack, but It would be nice if there’s more content in it.

I hope EA will refresh this pack soon.",Recommended

The rock wall is very meh, though it does supposedly level up the Rock Climbing skill from Snowy Escape if you happen to have that expansion too.
The earphones *are* really nice, though sometimes my Sims are a little weird about not wanting to use them. When they do use them, it's kinda OP to flip the music they're listening to to the Japanese station from Snowy Escape to build Emotionally Mindful really fast for a quick Emotion Surge.

2649,Moschino_Stuff 리뷰,"I really like the pack and use the build items often, but the item I use the most often is the tripod. I like having my sims display photographs (too many!) and it's fun to allow a few different poses into the mix.

Honestly, the new poses are entertaining, but disjointed. The tripod's best feature is that it allows the camera to rotate, so at parties and gatherings you can hunt for shots from several different angles. The lighting included with the pack, although labelled as photo studio, doesn't seem to make a difference to the lighting in the resulting photographs, so you can probably consider it as decor. I haven't played the included career yet, but I do have a teenager who will shortly be bullied into it, so we'll see how that goes.

Home decor is easy to use. Loud graphic rugs work well in kids and teenage rooms, or for zoning open spaces. The wallpapers are wonderfully noisy and interesting to mix and match across walls. The comfort items are on the small side, so they're easy to use around a TV, or to slot into a small empty space.

The CAS items are fun, exactly what you'd expect from the Moschino brand. Slicked back hair, shades, loud leather items, They don't seem to fit my more curvy characters very well, but that's RTW for you.",Recommended

Perhaps this stuff pack might also work better if combined with the Get Famous expansion pack as well for celebrities because at least some of the items in my opinion especially from CaS look like something a celebrity or wealthy sim might use as opposed to an average or poor sim using, and if not willing to spend at full price another option is to wait for a 30% discount.",Recommended

It has taken me 20 MINUTES to simply take a good photo.. I do not recommend- and I dont want you to waste money on it.",Not Recommended
2656,Moschino_Stuff 리뷰,"This isn't a clothing pack. It is a photography (and, less obviously - but I will explain) portrait-painting pack. Obviously the clothes are hideous, there are actually very few items, and the only obvious reason for this to exist is so that someone at EA could get a bonus/promotion for setting up a ""brand partnership"". BUT... if you want to have decent photos or portraits in-game, or if you want an Active career (Photographer) that is genuinely fun, then this pack is brilliant.

I'll explain:

Imagine that you have a very homey, domestic bunch of Sims; they will want photos of their kids on the walls, right? Imagine if you have a business tycoon; he'll want a portrait of himself over his desk, right? And your fashion influencer will want photos of herself or her friends looking fabulous. And your family-oriented Sims will want photos of their kids' weddings. Etc. Commemorating your Sims with photos or portraits seems like an obvious thing to do in the Sims!

But how do you do this in the base game? How do you get images of your Sims and their friends? You click to take a photo with a camera (remembering to select the larger photo size so the image is big enough), or you click Paint From Reference on the easel.. and then you wait for the lag and then get frustrated that the Sim you were trying to get an image of has moved and is now in a stupid pose, is walking away, etc.... so you try again, and again.... It's infuriating. Now, however....

With this pack, you set up a tripod, add a camera, and call the people you want to photograph across, and they will stand where you tell them (mostly), either individually or in a group. Then you can change their poses, zoom in or out, add filters, and generally make sure that you actually get a good photo. Great! Now, you can actually have photos of your beloved, your kids' weddings, your ex boyfriends, your boss, or whoever else you want on your walls - and playing through getting the photos is actually good fun (not another grinding click-fest - but satisfyingly simple!).

This also gives a work-around to get decent portraits for your wall. Take photos (largest size), select the one you want, put it on the wall, set the easel next to it, Paint From Reference, and move the view to take in the photo on the wall. And there you have it, a portrait of the well-composed and posed photo. Not ideal (maybe EA plan on selling us a proper way to do this later) but workable.

And along with this you'll get the Photographer freelance career, which is by far the most interesting of the Active careers.

That is a pretty good pack. And along with the photos functionality, portraits work-around and interesting freelance career, you'll also get some extra build items (the windows are good). Just don't pay any attention to the clothes - they aren't what this is about.",Recommended

However if you've looked at the gallery you've noticed that this pack is used a TON in builds and probably wondered what in the dickens for! The answer is windows. This pack has a few really unique but extremely versatile windows that fit a LOT of builds just right.

So, basically, for this pack you're paying whatever the sale price on $10 is for windows. You might like the photography freelancer job and one or two clothing pieces too. This is a very low priority stuff pack, but if you have a big pack collection and/or just enjoy building a lot, this might be a decent addition to your pack collection. I do not regret getting this pack at all, I even sort of like it in spite of the hideous clothing, but I can not say that I recommend it.",Not Recommended

The windows are the main feature of this DLC as they have a very industrial vibe for non-cc players. Otherwise, the Photography feature isn’t fully put together and often can be glitchy and unplayable.

2708,Tiny_Living_Stuff 리뷰,My favorite part about this pack is definitely the furniture. I love how much the Murphy bed with the bookcase saves space. And I also love how the items do save space. The items are actually nice looking and aren't ugly.,Recommended
2709,Tiny_Living_Stuff 리뷰,Having the option for bed/sofa is great when starting a new game when the sim doesn't have a lot of money or space in a home. Tiny living stuff makes small houses look cosy than empty and cheap.,Recommended

2712,Tiny_Living_Stuff 리뷰,The Sims series is an amazing game series that has a very talented/passionate development team. My review is not aimed towards them but their publisher which is well known for figuring out very creative ways to monetize every single aspect of their products where such beauty becomes so soulless. It does not help they obviously are at the developers throats to pump out as much content as they possibly can to fill up Their wallet.,Not Recommended
2713,Tiny_Living_Stuff 리뷰,"The tiny house system adds fun gameplay perks, but the build items are by far the best part of the pack.

2721,Tiny_Living_Stuff 리뷰,"Sims games are fun, but ea's new game pack makes me angry. The Chinese New Year became the Korean Lunar New Year. This is obvious theft. The poster after the change is still Hanbok. Chinese players aren't crazy to attack everywhere, it's just that our culture has been clearly stolen. For example, if other foreigners say that sushi is Korean, aren't Japanese angry? If pasta is Korean, aren't Italians angry? If fried fish is Korean, aren't the British angry? If Oktoberfest is Korean, aren't Germans angry? If the Russian matryoshka dolls is Korean, aren't the Russians angry? Chinese are not aggressive peoples, we just want to protect our culture！！！！！",Not Recommended

这是文化挪用 对中国玩家的不尊重
我玩了这游戏800小时，现在只想说RNM退钱！
EA如果不懂怎么做海报可以不做 懂吗？大过年的恶心人
We're happy to celebrate our most important festival with the world TOGETHER, but that doesn't mean that @thesims could represent the festival only by korean and show no respect to its original Chinese culture. Korean also celebrate Christmas, why not representing Christmas by them？The post celebrates lunar new year of tiger with korean costumes and Chinese dishes, deliberately mixing two culture. This is cultural appropriation and offending Chinese players.

2735,Tiny_Living_Stuff 리뷰,"I love this pack. I use items from it for every build. Very nice space-saving on furniture and design. The beds are annoying though. It designated the same amount of space taken to place it, and the choice ends up being ""leave it down all the time"" or waste several minutes putting it away / getting it out with a ridiculous animation and a chance of death that pops up too frequently. Once every dozen or so times would be okay, but it seems to be every 3-4th time of interacting with the beds.",Recommended

Be sure to upgrade them as soon as you get them or you Sim can be killed. I also enjoyed the all in one TV/Stereo system.

PROS:
The lawn slide building up the Fitness skill is nice

CONS:
Although Sims 3 Stuff Packs are $20 and Sims 4 Stuff Packs being $10 sounds like a better deal, it still isn't worth it.

Overall, this isn't worth the full price of $10. I have yet to spend any money on Sims 4, having gotten it when it was made free-to-play and all of my DLC being obtained when EA temporarily offered certain DLC packs for free... besides the 2014 Holiday Celebration Pack, which has always been free.

that being said, it's super scummy (although not surprising) that they didn't refund or otherwise credit the people who did buy this. there's over $700 worth of DLC for this game, EA (a multi-billion dollar company) can more than afford to be decent to the community that's supported this game throughout the years.",Recommended

It's really nice how they go especially well with some of the other packs, like the Cottage Living set. I'm pretty sure if you build a lot, especially if you like patios, terraces, and just fun in the yard in general, you'll enjoy this. As always, look up the contents of a pack in build and CAS mode to make sure you are satisfied with what it gives you. I think it's very nice!

2908,Laundry_Day_Stuff 리뷰,"Not sure I would recommend this DLC for Sims 4 or not.
As it stands from what I have seen of this ""Stuff Pack,"" you don't buy this pack to have your sims do Laundry.

The reason why I say this is simple:

- The Laundry Machines are kind of a hassle.
- They catch your sims on fire sometimes, then get destroyed.
- After you replace them, I couldn't get the Laundry Machines to work.

Putting that aside I would say the random fashions/furniture that you get in this ""Stuff Pack"" might be the only things to look forward to. So I would say take a long look at the items you get besides the Machines.

If looking to Purchase, I would recommend getting it on sale as the pack is only half working from what I can tell(?), though I have had just a bad experience testing out the Laundry Machines.",Recommended

Sims won't do their own laundry, you gotta do it manually, and if you forget to clean out the dryer filters there will be a fire.
So basically if your micro-managing game isn't on-point It makes their lives spiral out of control because of how trashy their surroundings are after about a day, and once they're sad from having dirty laundry everywhere they can't do dirty laundry because they're too uncomfortable to clean up all the dirty laundry that's making them uncomfortable.

2932,Laundry_Day_Stuff 리뷰,"It is strange that a Stuff DLC adds something like Laundry, but doesn't revamp or ensure that older related items like the base game hamper can support it!

1 Clothesline. 1 washer and dryer. 1 Washtub. A handful of wicker items. That's it. The associated gameplay isn't bad, but as always, it becomes a victim of the flaws and problems of the normal game. Why are there not laundromats? Why do sims not seem to be keen on taking care of any kind of chore on their own?

The asking price of 10 dollars demands that this game give you at least more than 1 choice in each subset. There should be at least 3 clotheslines. 3 washers and dryers. They should have reliability and swag differences. This was all possible using the existing game mechanics, and they didn't bother building the DLC out to meet the expectation.

Something about watching your sims get a massage or relax in the sauna really makes you crave going out to a real one.

But if your looking for some hippy zen guru stuff this is the pack for you.",Recommended
2952,Spa_Day_Game_Pack 리뷰,"I think its really cool that they finally added the new spa day. It's awesome that I no longer need to use an addon to have great looking nails!! But I am a little confused. There supposed to be 4 new venues. But I can't find them anywhere.

To Quote what I read::
""you’ll notice four new buildings in your My Library page within The Gallery. There are three Spas, ready to be plopped in any 20x30 lot you want. Aham Ashram Yoga Studio focuses on offering top tier yoga instruction; Center of Center Massage provides highly-trained masseuses and reflexologists to work out all your kinks; and Perfect Balance Spa has everything to enhance your wellness including a sauna and meditation! There’s also a Gym that includes some of the new objects found in the game pack""

I can't seem to find the venues above noted. I did find everything else; such as the nails in Create a Sims, and the new aspirations / trait.

Guess I'll uninstall all the sims expacs, stuff packs etc.. See if it was a bad installation.

I did try out the enw aspiration for a little. It's going to be a lot of fun....Woohoo!",Recommended
2953,Spa_Day_Game_Pack 리뷰,"This pack is nice. I wouldn’t call it a must have... but it’s interesting if you’re the type of TS4 player who really focuses on making the most out of the moodlet system without heavily relying on mods or cheats. This pack gets you the opportunity to get long lasting moodlets that can help your sim get a promotion or gameplay stuff.

The CAS outfits/hairdos are trash. The Build and Buy items are a bit dated, but they’re decent and versatile. There’s obviously a new « woohoo » location. I recommend you watch videos that shows every item before purchasing it, so you can see if this is worth €20 to you (€15 when on sale).

2955,Spa_Day_Game_Pack 리뷰,"A Very Revitalizing Pack Indeed To be Consider Into Your Usual Dull Sims Life

I don’t even know where to start because there is so much newness in here and all of them are fantastic additions to the catalogue. All these new items are so beautiful and have such an amazing synergy that it is going to be hard for me moving forward while decorating the houses because I am so going to use everything from this pack whenever I decorate houses especially the fish tanks, fountain walls and incense holders.

In term of fish tanks, you can stock them with fishes your sims have caught, or for easy way out - you can always buy the fish. Unlike the past Sims games, these tanks do not require feeding or cleaning, or feeding so you do not have to worry about how your fishes always died from negligence.

On the other hand, for the incense holders, it could help provide positive moodlets for your sims depending on what incense you lighting. However, be careful not to place the incense near any clothing material items such as curtains because these are known to cause fires at times.

The spa day activities are quite soothing and entertaining. I am very impress by the animations brought upon in this pack, especially the arms quaking during tough yoga poses. As your Sims’ wellness skill increases, your sims will learn new massages, new yoga poses, and new recipes. Sims who often meditate will also eventually be able to levitate and teleport.

2976,빈티지 홈 아이템팩 리뷰,"I want to give this one a ""mixed"" actually, because in theory I like it, in practice it's again full of bugs and shortcomings that I wish would finally be adressed by Maxis.
Of course there's one reason to get the pack, and that's the butler - all the rest is pretty forgettable, although some hairstyles are nice etc.
The butler is - when they work - areal fun addition, I truly enjoyed my first one - until I hired butlers for more households.
The major shortcoming now is that the butlers won't stay - they rotate and your favourite butler might appear one day and then you get butler #2 from that other family. Often the same butler works on two familes at the same time. So setting up your little butler room with a personal bed becomes pointless, you have to reassign the bed all the time. Or alternatively, fire the butler and get a new one - in that case you usually get the one you originally made for the family. Highly annoying, especially when your butler became an integral part of the family or a Sim started romancing one.

The second downer is that assigned butlers only appear for the active household - so if you made a cool creepy vampire butler for the Straud household and hoped to be greeted by him when you visit that house, forget it.

The conclusion is, butlers are fun and if you play a noble household they are the ideal addition when you actively play. But for immersion when your Sim just wants to visit other noble houses... safe your money.
It could've been so much more, if it just worked as expected. I recommend it on sale, if you can live with the shortcomings butlers are fun. If someone knows a mod that fixes them, please hit me up.",Recommended

2987,빈티지 홈 아이템팩 리뷰,"Want to adorn your Sims in stunning vintage fashions and accessories? Make-up at the vanity table? High-end furnishing and even hire a butler to pamper their every needs?

Clothing-wise, it is very old-fashioned and elegant. Granted, it may not be a look for all sort of sims, but they are pretty good options especially for formal looks. The new hairstyles are pretty on-point and stylish for a glamour look.

In term of furniture, the globe bar is definitely an interesting new addition that leave me the most impression in this pack. Great for your sims to have in their office, to pour some drink at the end of the day of hard works. Although, my favorite about this globe is the moment when your kids study the globe – get ready to squeak like dolphin because the animation is absolutely adorable. Little detail like this just added up more meaning and lively aspect into the game experience.

The next interesting feature from this pack is the Butler. The butler feature is very well-though out. Unlike the maids, they really work hard and do their duty. You can assign them responsibilities, make specific requests and even play music for you. If you have a dancefloor, there will be a very neat interaction. They are very regal and the animations are top-notch. Furthermore, if your sim wants to have the hands-on with repairs, gardening, cleaning or childcare, they can ask the butler not to perform any of those.

Overall, adds a lot of interactive elements to your usual gaming experiences. The interactive furniture such as the Globe Bar and Vanity Table are very well thought out and the animation are absolutely amusing to watch. For a Stuff Pac, it does add a lot of lively attribute into your usual Sims life.",Recommended

I would rate this neutral or inbetween if it was possible but it isnt, so I can only recommend this at half price

'Vintage Glamour'


This dlc introduce a small variety of clothing and furniture which I consider mostly useless unless you wanna spend 10 bucks on a haircut for your simmer, so that isnt why I voted this positive, the only thing that makes this dlc great is the personal butler which came with the base game in The Sims 3 but they decided was fitting better in a dlc for The Sims 4, I wonder why..$ ?

The butlers works similar to The Sims 3 but they do have a lot more personality in The Sims 4, like your butlers personally depends on their simmers traits, so you can end up having to fire the first few butlers, till you find one that doesnt steal your belongings or flirt with your partner. But beside that it works like The Sims 3, they require a room in your house to live in and they cost a lot more than a normal house keeper and you hire them over the phone like any other service.

I'll recommend this on sale.",Recommended

3029,파라노말 아이템 팩 리뷰,"Nice idea, amazingly badly implemented.

Consider:
* To become a paranormal investigator you need to max out your mediumship skill. This takes almost no time at all - you can do it in a day or so - so it isn't a challenge; it seems pointless even having the requirement.
* But then, once you start, you have nowhere else to go, skills-wise - unlike every other career, where you start out being a bit rubbish and build skills to help get promoted.
* The paranormal investigations are all ""look at the map, click on stuff"" (click to destroy spooky doll, click to ask spirit to leave, etc.) - no planning, no choices, just do-what-you're-told.
* In an attempt to make this interesting, EA have decided that your Sim will sometimes get Terrified and refuse to do anything. So in a game where you tell Sims to do stuff, your Sims refuse do do stuff. That isn't interesting. It is infuriating.
* You cannot, Scooby-Doo-style, have multiple Sims help with one investigation. I guess having different Sims with different skills might be too much like strategy or choice.
* To stop the investigations being frustrating, you can buy a Brave Trait for... 8,000 points! So, more points than you might otherwise spend on all your Sim's traits in their lifetime, on one trait, just to stop the investigations being annoying? Really?
* Meanwhile, if you play this as a passive career (don't ""follow"" your Sim) then this becomes the most profitable career that you can choose as a starting / Young Adult Sim straight out of school, with complete freedom to choose what days you work. Start with a couple or a handful of young adults, and your household will make thousands of $ every day that you choose for them to work. Which frankly feels like a cheat, and makes no sense.

Your Sim also gets Scared/Terrified with varying levels of ease, which makes normal activities either impossible or delayed.

You can easily change lot types to make a house/lot ""haunted"" or not. Specters get a little annoying but Guidry will explain how you can keep them at bay. Also, if you get tired of the place being haunted, you can always switch back to regular residential lot in build mode. Some nice stuff is included (lighting, sculptures, rugs, etc) that add to the whole haunted house theme. Paranormal Investigator career option is a nice bonus, too.",Recommended
3034,파라노말 아이템 팩 리뷰,"I think this pack is fun in theory and bad in execution. I'm so glad they added more supernatural content for sims. Unfortunately they did not make it very fun to play.
the fun part of sims is making your sims do things, and terrified sims become incapable of doing anything.

if you want your sim to live in a haunted house you either make sure that the ghosts absolutely adore you (and by extension avoid as much of the pack as you can) or the game devolves in to a miserable resource management game where your sim is too scared to do anything and making a sandwich takes multiple in game hours. Not to mention this will happen in the middle of the night so hopefully your sim doesn't have a job to get to. The ghosts don't do anything exciting they just scare your sim and then break all your appliances, forcing you to spend time repairing them, or costing you a small fortune in repairs. I was hoping it would at least be exciting to deal with angry ghosts. it was not.

Is the paranormal investigator position fun at least? No. you CAN follow your sim to work, but why would you? as soon as your sim gets scared they become incapable of working. they can't even properly get rid of the items required to cleanse the house. Sure, you can place down a seance circle and try to purify the house that way assuming you don't get interrupted by anyone else in the house and your sim is well rested.

I did have fun with the pack, and I don't think it's so bad it's irredeemable, but an expansion pack dedicated entirely to ghosts should make dealing with ghosts fun or exciting and it doesn't. Above all else this pack is frustrating.

ALSO ghosts on your property (even benevolent ones) will stop the game from letting you go max speed when all your sims are asleep. It's not a major issue but it does mean you have to spend a little more time doing nothing and feels like bad design. Especially considering that unlike neighbors you cannot ask them to leave. if I am wrong about being unable to make them leave feel free to tell me.",Not Recommended

3063,즐거운 주방 아이템 팩 리뷰,"Honestly it's not remotely worth the price, but I really do love having my sims eating so many flavours of icecream.

As far as I can tell the icecream has absoloutely no effect on anything, although it does fill their hunger needs.
I haven't noticed any sorts of moodlets from the icecream, or any recognition that they're eating icecream.

Your machine will make a carton/tub of icecream (which will turn up in their inventory), and you will be able to take single servings from it in either a bowl or a cone. You can also set the topping & garnish (eg cherry and waffle pieces), which is just cute.

I've never had a sim autonomously make icecream, although they will take a serving if it's sitting out - but other players have said that the icecream machine has the same problem for them as the coffee machine; sims will constantly make icecream non-stop and will prioritise it over every other action.

*Of course, if you combine this pack with the Dine Out pack, you can make an icecream parlour. I like having a really cutesy icecream parlour and setting it with traits like ""good schools"", ""teen hangout"", and family/child orientated lot traits. The idea of kids gathering to eat icecream while they study is just too adorable!",Recommended

There is a new fridge and a new stove.. The only real new ""Cool Kitchen"" appliance is the Ice cream machine, and while that is pretty great... I literally cannot/will not use it because the sims, like with the bar, literally want to use it twenty four/seven. I would have to fence it off just like I do the bar, and keep it locked up til I actually want to use it. I really don't want to lock things up all around my house so I am probably never going to use it unfortunately. You also only get 23 new objects and as I said only the ice cream machine is new really. You can make packs for building or furniture and decor/new CAS items, but to fill a pack dedicated to cool kitchen stuff or anything specific like this with a bunch of junk instead of cool kitchen appliances is a rip off.

This is actually the sort of DLC I'm personally okay with, as the game is definitely complete without it -- it just adds some fun extra stuff if you happen to pick this up on sale or as part of a bundle.

I mostly picked this up because of the ice cream maker, specifically because

I will say that I dislike that sims will put the finished ice cream in their inventory instead of automatically serving it (like any other food). I suppose it stops them from just deciding to make and eat ice cream whenever they want, but that's really my only gripe.",Recommended

For me the main draw to this pack was the ice cream machine, and honestly? I was disappointed with it. The ice cream looks really cool, and all the topings/garnish look fantastic. But it takes too long to make, your sims CAN get fat off eating a lot of the ice cream because Sims 4 has a (background) calorie system (which is somewhat aggressive), and the buffs from only a few of the ice cream flavors are *very* random.

So straight to the movies, they serve no purpose, have poor interactions, have NO integration with other systems (such as holidays), and have entirely missable mood buffs (which are small enough to be pointless anyways). There is no benefit or even recognition for having Sims watch movies together. Movies can not be used to complete holiday objectives, nor to gain skills, making them worse than watching a TV channel. I want to love the movies, but they are simply bad.

Similarly, there is absolutely no point to the popcorn. It is a high calorie food, so it will make your sims fat. It has no special buffs, or any particular reason to use it.

The CAS items do have a few really nice pieces for casual clothing. The BB has a handful of very strong accent pieces, which can be a reason to buy this pack on sale alone. The massive TVs from this pack are so large that they often do not even fit into mansion builds.

Incidentally, one of the items it includes is an outdoor projection TV. If you put that outside your house in a place that's accessible, people drop by to watch videos with you.

The biggest additions to The Sims™ 4 Movie Hangout Stuff are the popcorn maker and the TV movies. It does not sound like much, but there is actually a lot going on under the hood that impacts gameplay in more ways than previous Stuff Packs. While we get two very large new TVs to decorate, but the new movies did not limit to just the new TVs. This, I think, was a very good move from the Stuff Pack creators as it means that we can enjoy the new gameplay without having to change our old TVs to the huge televisions.

Some of the movies can be very dark too; try watching the Moonlight Massacre III with your Sims and see what I mean! Yes, your Sims will react to the movie too. If it is scary on screen, they’ll jump. The same goes for sad movies; Sims may cry. I actually like this little detail of feature as it makes the Sims feel more aware about what they are watching. Your Sims can also make a particular movie genre their favorite too via a friendly social interaction which will influence the gained moodlets.

The next fascinating item this pack has brought is the popcorn machine. There are three different flavors of popcorn that your Sims can make but two of them require your Cooking Skill. Something I particularly like about the popcorn is that the Sims will actually pick out the popcorn with their fingers and eat it – I was almost terrifies if I’m going to see a fork and spoon. If the Sims are eating popcorn while watching a movie, they will send their popcorn flying everywhere as they react to the movie.

Overall, could be a fantastic addition if you are seeking for unique change to your game play such as the Sims’ personalities and reaction. The animation is definitely worth of watching.",Recommended

3125,온실가꾸기 키트 리뷰,"Normally I don't straight off and buy game packs. I bought it cause it sucks making a greenhouse /garden with whatever the game offers. Is it worth it? For some no its not worth it, others might think its worth it. In the end it depends on the player.

I find some of the items useful for non-greenhouse builds. The windows especially which I already used in a build. The hanging baskets look cute as hell placed in front of the entry way, or wherever you want some greenery. Furniture can be also used for non gardening purposes. I even used the shelf in a bathroom to place plants and items on, so the ideas are endless if you use your imagination.

In the end, is this pack worth it? Heck yeah if you do builds and stuff. I like the fact you can finally have a greenhouse to make your own Little Pet Shop of Horrors as long the cow plant stop eating the gardener.",Recommended

If you have the money, I would recommend buying for the decorators out there. The default swatch is gold, which is ugly in my opinion, but the other options are so beautiful. You get 1 floor and wall swatch, which are also kinda ugly too. The kit does seem very boujie but you can use the other colour options (and objects from other packs) to turn that around. The peachy/earthy tones on basically all the items match great, the style doesn't necessarily need to be modern! The curtains, paintings and pillows were a big selling point for me, the curtains very basic, elegant and can fit across almost any window with the new curtain rod item. The pillows look great as clutter around/on the bed, or even the sofa. Also, the pre-made room they give you is amazing I really like the neutral colour scheme. The record player (functional) is also something I've been wanting for the longest time in this game and the swatches are perfect! Most of the items are for the bedroom, and do hold this upper-class feel about them but aren't the most expensive (kind of reminds me of the items in Get Famous but way less ugly). I would definitely recommend to the people who love modern style, but this kit works in other ways too. Solid 7/10, I feel like you get more Buy items than other kits.",Recommended

If toddlers were originally part of base game I feel as if them being combined together could have been more likely as well.

3172,인천공항 패션 키트 리뷰,"These clothing items are absolutely beautiful. They have a neutral range of color swatches, so they are easy to match with any other type and style of clothes. However, as the clothing is mostly a little oversized, most of it will need to be paired with bulkier clothing and looks strange with stuff like skinny jeans. This also has a benefit too: This is some of the best clothing in the game for overweight Sims, as it doesn't morph as bad and isn't in unflattering cuts for large bodies.

The singular bad note I have is that one of the sweatpants have been warped since the High School Years expansion patch.

My biggest complaint is the book model/texture on the shelves is very low quality, that looks blocky and cartoonish. Additionally, there are only 3 swatches of book color variations (repeated for every shelf color), which don't look very good next to each other. This means that putting the modular pieces together to make very large bookshelves actually results in a fairly bad looking book wall, and you are better off using other large bookshelf items over these.

3211,파스텔 팝 키트 리뷰,"Overall

Pros: This kit seems like the Sims is paving its way fully from the 2010s to the 2020s, with decor that is inspired by the 1960s/70s. What can I say other than it really is super cute, aesthetic, and I love to see such pretty pastel colors make its way into the game. It's visually pleasing and the newer shelves are easy to add collectibles onto from other game objects.

Cons: Sims kits are notoriously small in actual content and this kit is no different. With only 21 objects, 2 wallpapers, and 1 option for carpet. It just seems like a shame to spend $4.99 on a DLC that contains so little when there's so much to be explored with this particular look. There's not even different beds, just one, which drives me bonkers because it's so cumbersome and takes up the whole room depending on your starter home. The rugs are also far too small and the cookie-inspired one just didn't do it for me, nor did I know it was based off a cookie just by looking at it coming from a design point. Just think of the possibilities if the developers took some inspiration from Otaku/Kawaii culture, keeping limited space and funds in mind to create a cozy space with all of your clutter. I feel like to improve on this kit, they should focus on adding some other options that will justify its existence, otherwise I can't in good conscience recommend purchasing it again.",Not Recommended
3212,파스텔 팝 키트 리뷰,"This kit is worth it for the tablet model computer alone to me. This is a fully functional computer for <1k simoleons - Never use that hideous block computer again! While comparable in price to the Strangerville 1k laptop, this tablet computer has a much higher quality model, with MUCH more color swatch variation.

I also particularly love the rock salt lamp. The pin board is very ugly colors, but there is only one other of these in the game, making this a notable addition. The wallpapers make a nice accent wall, though they can look tacky if simply used to fill a room.

The rest of this kit is pretty much a waste of vomit-inducing pastel combinations, and bad looking arbitrary abstract shapes. A few of the clutter items are salvageable by using their least absurd color swatches and tucking them next to normal items. Or some of it might look fitting in a child's bedroom.",Recommended

The bistro kit has some cool stuff. New door, archway, window, mirror, divider, tiles, bar, seats (one table chair, bench seat, and bar stool), wall panel, and tables. There's 3 new lights (ceiling, table, and wall), a coffeemaker, and some decor to match. It's pretty nice stuff for a small cafe. The kit has a classic old time (maybe 1920's/30's?) feel to it.

But, as with all the kits, if plants aren't your thing there is no reason to buy it as that is all that is in this one.",Recommended
3245,블루밍 룸 키트 리뷰,"EASILY worth $5 for the kit.

There are 24 items total, including 16 decorative items, 2 beautiful tables, a large plant lamp, and several shelves in this kit that feel new and unique from what comes in the original game. Each item has many great options with the Design Tool (8 options on the lowest end, with most offering 9 or 12 options). These options change the color of the plant pots, the stand/holders, and even the tint of the plant and the leaves itself (including variegated options!). There is even a citrus bush, although it doesn't offer any interaction, it still looks amazing.

Most, if not all, of these items will be appearing in every house that I design moving forward, FOR SURE.

There are 2 staples I shove into almost every build (including the ceiling plant that's very unique), a few more I use occasionally, and most I don't touch (some are really ugly). It's cheap enough that I'm satisfied with that, but if you're not you may want to look up a better view of each item included, because the preview photos from EA do not do a good job at displaying all the pieces.",Recommended

I think if you're looking for a 90s or 2000's Victorian goth look, this pack can complement the style you're looking for, namely one of the boots and the gloves. Other than that you don't really need this and there are stuff from other packs that cater to that goth style like Realm, Vampires, Moonlit, Get Famous, Spooky, etc. But if you wanna make nu metal, industrial, black metal, punk themed sims, yes.

3289,고스 스타일 키트 리뷰,"This is a very tepid thumbs up, where a ""mixed"" button would have been preferable to a binary yes/no.
The models and textures in this kit are well made, they look nice in game, and I am happy to see more goth clothing added. I am overall happy to have the addition to the game, but I also feel like there's a lot of missed opportunity in this kit, and several things that were simply poorly done.

So to the complaints, because while I will recommend it if you want the style, I also think you should know what to expect;
- All 3 of the female tops are reskins of the same model. They have VERY different textures that change the shirt drastically under each option, but it's still obviously the same base model which ends up feeling like it's a dozen different ways to accessorize one shirt.
- The lipstick does not fit Sim lips and looks very strange, though the colors are nice. Also, it is not flagged for masculine Sims.
- There is no white face paint. There is no high coverage pale blush.
- The eyeshadow looks horrible. Just a giant smear of black eye with no sense or shape which completely missed the mark. The colored swatches are slightly better, but still pretty bad.
- This kit does not come with any hairstyles, and even when you own every other pack there are extremely few hairstyles in the game as a whole that work well not only for goth fashion but this particular style of it. Male Sims especially do not have suitable hairstyles.
- Most pieces are not flagged for different outfit categories, especially hot/cold weather and party, thus you will have to dismiss the default filters quite a bit for this clothing.",Recommended

3300,고스 스타일 키트 리뷰,"Positives:
* I really like the direction they took with the swatches, where some tops feel like a completely different item.
* The lipstick finally gives us a proper black swatch (that actually looks good), and the form is actually different to most of the other lipsticks in game (in a good way).
* The makeup + accessories are generally quite good.
* Some of the items (the skinny jeans, the tall boots, the fem tops, the gloves) are so nice I'll probably be using them all the time.

Negatives:
*The male clothes look quite boring compared to what female sims got. Would have loved to see pants with a half skirt rather than... cargo shorts... or a less conservative vest design (more leather/straps/metal/etc). The vampires pack does a better job at male goth fashion than this kit.
* Overall, the pack is way too ""safe"" to be proper goth (it's more ""e-girl emo"" + some black clothes off clearance).
* The hood top is bugged atm, making sims face look weird (huge eyes).

Other:
* I'm not really sure why some items have a baby pink/blue swatch to them. Like, kudos for the variety, but people who are going to buy this pack want ""Goth"" not necessarily ""pastel goth"", it would have been better to just focus on one thing? (if they wanted an alternative swatch to the blacks they could have went with a pure white/white+red swatch)

If you have the Wedding pack, then you already have the buffet/drinking fountain, which makes this stuff pack more useless.

The luxurious thing about this stuff pack are the clothes. At least the formal gowns and cocktail dresses look quite nice, at least for me anyway. Love the shoes too. But that's it.

All of the CAS items are for age Teen/Adult/Elder, and there is significantly more for female Sims than male.

Compared to other stuff packs, I have to rate this a low priority for lacking features. There's nothing in here that will change your game, or really impact anything more than how you dress up / decorate.",Recommended
3329,럭셔리 파티 아이템 팩 리뷰,"Add A Bit of Sparkle to Your Sims’ Events and Life

In my opinion, the single biggest gameplay-impacting item in The Sims™ 4 Luxury Party Stuff is the Fountain of Mirth. This new fountain can be placed on one of two buffet tables where you can serve with any dishes you purchased or cooked. Meanwhile, you can fill the fountain with several of drinks available in the options such as chocolate, cheese, caramel and so on.

Their availability are mainly based on your Sim's Mixology and Cooking skill levels. If you have level 5 in either, you can 'Improve' food or drink once it is in the fountain. This could give Sims a +2 Happy Moodlet for 4hour after eating or drinking from it. Sims who have level 4 Mischief can taint the fountain's contents to give Sims a +2 Uncomfortable moodlet.

This pack indeed provide the best female clothing and hair options in the catalogue – especially the evening dresses. I sincerely appreciate the subtle and bright color clothing options.

All in all, while this pack may be smaller in scope than what we are used to with the rest of the stuff packs, it does have some fun new gameplay items.

3337,중세의 성 키트 리뷰,"I feel the Sims scams us a little with stuff like this, which I do not like, but I pay them anyway because the sims is very fun. Overpriced on some items, but still fun! I really like this kit though, just wish there were more items added to this kit!

Looking at the other reviews I do have to say for five dollars it's definitely worth the price on how little it is (and for 25 GB of storage... strangely?) because I mean, seriously, it's only five bucks, what were you expecting, a whole whopping 100 GB of stuff? Like I said I wish there were more items added to this kit, like styles of different castles like extra Victorian or maybe even Scandinavian or, just, something! Maybe even royalty can be added so we don't have to use mods, kind of like a Get Famous game pack but with royalty and all kinds of titles like jesters, kings, queens, peasants, knights, etc.! Aaaaaand... maybe even wardrobe items, because nothing in the catalog except the costumes from Get Famous (when your sim reaches max celebrity status) that actually match the medieval style. And there's only two that actually do, one male and one female... which is horrible for creators like me. Another idea is maybe a dragon sim occult? Half human, half dragon? It may be a reach though, now that I'm typing it. But it would be fun for knights to battle and even for your sim to play as a sim-dragon... thing! There could also be added hairs for an extra medieval or castle feel, I feel this kit would have been way better.

I, however, do not feel that it is a waste of money, five bucks for a beautiful build I can create is not that bad with the stuff already in the base game or in my bought packs. For example, Vampires has a dark medieval Victorian vibe to it, but that's about it. Cottage Living provides lots of plants, but I just like that for the decoration indoors. There was just so much missed opportunity with this pack, and this NEEDS more items!! If they do make an Expansion or Game Pack on this, maybe with a world to travel too as well, I'd buy it!",Recommended

3339,중세의 성 키트 리뷰,"This kit has one job, to provide build assets for making a castle, and it performs the job. All the stone textures match really well, and function decently with other textures in the game. The windows come in a useful variety of sizes.

I do wish there were some smaller matching doors in this kit, but the Cottage Living doors match the style well enough for interior doors. It also could have used more wall decor items for castle exterior details.",Recommended

3341,중세의 성 키트 리뷰,great!,Recommended
3342,중세의 성 키트 리뷰,"I recommend this but only slightly.

The stone block pattern comes in a small variety of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" colors. The clean looks like basic stone. The dirty has a dark area at the top that looks weathered or like moss or soot.

The build items aren't that many and some of them look weird in live builds, like the llama gargoyle thingy. The arched doors and windows are pretty big. Being made for a castle build, everything definitely looks better on medium or tall walls.

The weathered floor is kind of nice outside and inside for that cold castle feeling.

The fence selection is lame. It's only a stone wall, a handrail (which is kind of nice), but no castle-worthy gate.

They could have made a few more items, like a gate and more decorations, to make it worth the money even though it's only $5. Overall, it's pretty meh. It's cool because I like the additions to my castle, but they could have made a much better kit.",Recommended

3344,중세의 성 키트 리뷰,"I think the preview doesn't do the kit justice, since this kit actually has a lot of really good swatches (clean, grime gradient, grimey, mossy, etc). Although Get Together/Vampires/University do let you create castle builds, it's great to actually have build items geared towards making rock & stone castles, with actual doors/gates to accomodate the style (I built a castle just before this pack came out, and although it did come out looking good, I did struggle with finding doors/windows that can handle multi-story double wall-height + trying to make Crenellations with the fences I had).
You'll probably want to visit House of Harlix to actually find furniture for the interior, since furnishing a castle without CC is a /struggle/",Recommended

I felt like a lot of my homes were more sanitized and felt too much like a model home rather than a real home that my sims lived in, but the level of detail added with the items in this kit was OUTSTANDING for fixing that problem! I can understand others' gripes with there not being enough in this pack, but it's on par with the amount of items in other kits + they're very versatile and very easy to use anywhere and in any situation, unlike other kits which may be themed and only useful in certain situations.

Seriously, the clutter items are often the best items in MANY other packs and kits. I am thrilled for an entire kit of clutter. And there is a little touch from this kit for every sort of Sim.

The real stand out item of this kit is the ""Boom Blocks"" item, which is a radio. It's small enough to snap into any point that you usually want to fit a radio, and it looks like that Kaboom Box or HiFive High Fidelity Stereo should fit and then inexplicably doesn't. Goodbye to those woes, because this speaker fits everywhere! Visually too, it can fit anywhere from next to a TV, to on a computer desk, to alone on a porch with your rocking chair.

Remember to support games similar to the Sims {Paralives is currently in development and looks very promising}

Otherwise, this kit is basically an extension for Cottage Living in the form of an alternate kitchen set and more rustic kitchen clutter. I do like this kitchen/counter set better than Cottage Living's set for building in Henford-on-Bagley, or any other country, rural, cottage-y build. Some of the clutter is nice in any build.

To the too few items reviews: This kit is mostly counters and cabinets, which are each ""one"" item made up of about 6 to 10 matching items. Each of the positional variations of the counters and cabinets has a LOT of detail compared to most other counters and cabinets in the game.

3399,로맨틱 가든 아이템팩 리뷰,"Without checking the description of this DLC again after installing it I doubt I'd notice the included items in-game because there's only four features. I had to write down the name of the DLC and search for it on the Steam Store search box otherwise I couldn't find it due to the fact that the game is overcooked with 75 DLC products.

One of the features wrongly describes floral fashion as ""modern"" (unless the game was set in the 1920's). I tried to use one of the items, but the in-game cost of it (the Wishing Well) is ridiculous at $7,775. I felt like it would have been pointless not to use the item, so I bought it to try it (almost bankrupting my sim), but all the item did was temporarily prevent my sim from gaining skill levels.

It felt like an underwhelming waste of money in-game (losing $1,555 when selling it back), which doesn't help give the DLC any sense of value for money at £8.99. I got it for free, but couldn't recommend buying it.

Types of wishes and positive outcomes are:
Child: Overwhelmingly positive outcome results in a child being added to the household instantly.
Wealth: Positive outcomes can result in winning a few Simoleons or even winning the lottery, over $10,000.




However, be aware of the negative consequences because it’s rather easy to die from the negative aspects of the wishing well.

Types of wishes and negative outcomes are:


The mood of the well can be influenced by making an offering, with three levels of offerings you can give from § 100 to § 5000. Outcomes ranging from an overwhelmingly positive reaction giving your Sim exactly what they want, all the way to death.

3447,로맨틱 가든 아이템팩 리뷰,"It doesn't give enough. The main takeaway is the wishing well. You get some clothing items, some backyard stuff. It seems less than the kits and you get way more in them. If it wasn't free I wouldn't recommend it. it's free so sure get it some extra stuff.

The arches and the statues are a nice touch. the extra flowers, but like I mentioned the only thing worth your while is the wishing well. the flowers are nice, and it gives more romance I guess to the games in an atmospheric way.

I'm glad the Sims is giving away more free packs. kit or stuff pack.

3460,로맨틱 가든 아이템팩 리뷰,"Overall:

The Sims 4 Romantic Garden Stuff is a charming and whimsical Stuff Pack that adds a touch of romance and elegance to your Sims' lives. It's a great option for players who want to create a more romantic atmosphere in their games, and it's especially appealing to those who enjoy decorating with plants and flowers.

Pros:

Beautiful new plants and flowers: Romantic Garden Stuff introduces a variety of new plants and flowers that are perfect for creating a romantic atmosphere. These items are all high-quality and detailed, and they'll add a touch of elegance to your Sims' homes and yards.
Iconic wishing well: The expansion's centerpiece is the wishing well, a classic Sims item that has been reimagined for The Sims 4. The wishing well is a fun and interactive object that allows Sims to make wishes, and it's sure to bring a touch of whimsy to your games.
Romantic furniture and décor: Romantic Garden Stuff also includes a selection of new furniture and décor items, all inspired by the theme of romance. These items include benches, fountains, and statues, and they'll help you create the perfect romantic haven for your Sims.
New romantic interactions: The expansion also introduces a few new romantic interactions, such as the ability for Sims to gaze into each other's eyes and stroll hand-in-hand. These interactions are a great way to deepen your Sims' relationships and add a touch of romance to their lives.
Cons:

Limited CAS items: Romantic Garden Stuff has a relatively small selection of CAS items, focusing mainly on romantic-themed clothing and hairstyles. While the items are all high-quality, there are not as many options as some players might prefer.
Lack of depth in gameplay: The expansion's gameplay additions are relatively light on content. The wishing well is a fun item, but it doesn't have a ton of depth to its interactions. The new romantic interactions are also a bit limited.
Overall, The Sims 4 Romantic Garden Stuff is a lovely and well-made Stuff Pack that adds a touch of romance and elegance to your games. The new plants and flowers, the wishing well, and the romantic furniture and décor are all of high quality and will add a touch of whimsy to your Sims' lives. However, the expansion's limited CAS items and lack of depth in gameplay might disappoint some players.

Here are some of the specific things that I liked about the expansion:

The beautiful new plants and flowers are a great addition to the game.
The iconic wishing well is a fun and interactive object.
The romantic furniture and décor items are perfect for creating a romantic atmosphere.
The new romantic interactions are a great way to deepen your Sims' relationships.
Here are the things that I would like to see improved in the expansion:

The CAS items should be more diverse and extensive.
The gameplay additions should be more substantial and engaging.
Overall, The Sims 4 Romantic Garden Stuff is a charming and well-made Stuff Pack that is worth checking out for fans of the Sims series. It's a great way to add a touch of romance and elegance to your games, and it's especially appealing to those who enjoy decorating with plants and flowers.

Those charged jewelleries/cut gems are very fun to play yet and it's quite nice to add some spices to your gameplay. it's fun to playy with it and some are quite op like immune to death. Bbs are nice, however most are kinda like for workshop, so don't expect to use this pack just to build a house.

The game play is extensive and the jewelry is beautiful. There is truly loads of different combinations to pick from when making your own jewelry and the buffs that come with certain types are super beneficial to game play.

There is not an underwear category of clothing in the game. (The mod Wicked Whims has one, but kits shouldn't be best used by mods...) Meaning that this underwear is best suited to sleepwear, where its usefulness is *extremely* hit or miss. You can turn off the outfit category filters to use them for like swimwear or hot weather clothes... But then your Sim needs to be the sort of person that just strips into undies to swim, or goes around casually in public undressed when it's hot. I do really like this kit. But its content is beyond frivolous.",Not Recommended
3502,언더웨어 컬렉션 키트 리뷰,"As a realistic review, there are a lot of mods that has much better lingerie therefore this kit is not a ""must buy"" as well as other kits. On the other hand even with all the other packs, there is not sufficient underwear. Hence this kit is a perfect addition to your collection if you are interested in romantic gameplay. On the other hand if you have no interest in lingerie or any intentions to upload your Sims to gallery, free mods would be more than enough for you.",Recommended

I personally only like the longer boxers, the pants, 1 bra and the basically pink bikini bottom. I'm not really gonna see the boxers, the pants are nice, if my sim was a woman I'd use the ""NOS"" bra, but I'd use the pink bikini bottom for swimwear.

Kit packs can also not get discounts or be sold in bundles currently (contrary to expansion packs, gamepacks, and stuff packs) that do usually not really add that much when it comes to actual gameplay. The CaS items could potentially be versatile (such as maybe using for swimwear for example) and overall not bad looking, but at the same time it is not one of the first packs a player should get.",Recommended

Nice new stuff, with an Scandanavian vibe. Little tip: When you start out with this career, ask a lot of questions at the start of every gig! Especially colour, hobbies and interests.

Surprising for a bbs pack, it has some nice cas too, but the selection is small so yeah. The interior decorator is one of my most favourite career in the game, you can renovate those ugly houses to be more polished now. The career is not bugged for me, only that my sim won't return to home after the gigs, the before and after transformation clip is so cool. I think overall, it's only worth it if you like to build, or else get other dlcs first. There's a weird bug before the patch, where if there's infant in the customer's home, it keep blocking them check around the house which it makes the gig unable to complete, I guess it's fixed now.",Recommended
3510,나의 드림하우스 게임팩 리뷰,"Almost four years later, this is still unplayable. The game doesn't end gigs so the only thing you can do is cancel them which leads to a drop in reputation, plus you can never advance on you career because you never finish the job. Also the icons over the clients' heads indicating that they're ready for the final evaluation get stuck there after you cancel the gig. I've had sims that were children when the gig happened die of old age with the thing over their heads. This is a lot of money for zero gameplay. The CAS and build stuff isn't worth the money, not even on sale.

TLDR; do NOT buy this, not even on sale.",Not Recommended
3511,나의 드림하우스 게임팩 리뷰,"Here is the good, the bad, and the ugly about this game pack.

The Good- They have FINALLY brought back the sectional sofa! After playing The Sims with a sectional sofa it was ALMOST impossible to play it without them! I LOVE to decorate so this pack seemed right up my alley and for the build items alone it is great!

The sorta good- I find the decorator career to be really fun some of the time, but sometimes you give the client exactly what they want based on the 3 or 4 prompts and they don't like it. For example, a family hired me to makeover their kids room. I interviewed them and they said Dislikes yellow, Dislikes White, Likes Fitness, Likes Fitness. I find the one room with a kids bed and assumed it was the kids room. I made the walls gray and black (not yellow or white) I added black furniture, a punching bag and lockers with some sports themed stuff on the walls. I was incredibly frustrated when they didn't like it. I felt like it didn't make any sense!

The Bad and Ugly- At the end of a job they give you the option to host a viewing where you show off the remodel and ask what they think and it gives your prompts for things you have to ask them but it NEVER works. If you choose to show them them the room you will NOT be paid and you will not even be able to go home so effectively the game gets frozen here and you cannot save your progress. This sucks but I've learned to not show off the house. I have also never got a promotion even though I was excellent in reputation and performance. I have had to cheat my promotions because it is broken.

So my overall thoughts are that I NEED this pack for the furniture and I got it on sale so I am relatively happy but if you want it to work well in the career without cheats then you better pass on this one. If you don't mind cheating your promotions and you aren't worried about never showing off the house to your clients then you will probably enjoy this game. I'm mixed on recommending it because I love my sectional sofa and I do enjoy the career but its fundamentally broken and doesn't seem to be getting a fix anytime soon!",Recommended

Often it is unclear what room you are supposed to decorate. Sims are able to move through the walls and freeze after that for a couple of game hours.
My clients are often dissatisfied with my work even if i do some stupid looking decorations only with the preferences they`ve provided to me.
WTF am i supposed to do with preference ""loves programming"" while I`m decorating your stupid bathroom.
There are some money added to your budget when you reveal your work to your clients, but when you close the gig it says that they are saddened and you`ve earned 0.

The set guidelines and client's likes and dislikes are good challenges so far. I do prefer high budget gigs but for a really good challenge I go for those with small budget too. It's a refreshing to be actually ""doing work"".

However I grew tired at some point, and part of that reason were some bugs I noticed. (1) There are times when I exit a saved a game midway of a gig, the before pictures are not included when I come back. This takes away some excitement on my end because I really enjoy the before and after shots when revealing the renovated space. Also, (2) I'm not sure if this is intentional but after I'm done with a gig, people I've met there still has that ""final verdict"" icon on top of their head even if I'm just seeing them normally walking on the neighborhood.

Purchase at your own discretion. Personally, the things I like about the game outweigh the bugs so I still recommend this pack. I would probably reselect this career in the next generation of my current sim. Hopefully these bugs are gone by then.",Recommended

3534,나의 드림하우스 게임팩 리뷰,"I was honestly so excited to buy this pack, however it's bugged out to the point it's basically unplayable.

Anytime I go to do a home renovation, the 'gig' never ends. You're given a list of tasks to complete, and even after you complete every single one the gig continues. For my first renovation I did all the tasks, and instead of a pop-up showing up saying I completed the job like it's supposed to, no pop-up ever appeared, and it didn't pay my sim. In fact, it didn't even send me home so I had to use the phone to travel home. Even if you wait until 9 PM, which is when the gig is meant to end on it's own, you're still stuck at the lot.

The second gig I did also never ended, but this time it didn't allow me to travel home on my own. Instead I had to cancel the gig after I spent thirty minutes renovating the room, then the pop-up finally appeared and it told me I made no money and my professionalism dropped. Once you start a gig, they don't end on their own like they are supposed to and it's extremely frustrating and makes the career unplayable.

3539,나의 드림하우스 게임팩 리뷰,"I have very mixed feelings about this pack, as I do not like most Scandanavian furniture, and most of this pack looks like IKEA garbage to me. This is only a thumbs up by a very narrow margin, because not everyone hates this style like I do, and it is an extremely prominent pack on the gallery thus useful to have when downloading builds. However this is basically an oversized Stuff Pack, and I hate MOST of the furniture in it. This was not worth its sale price.

That said, there are a few stellar items in here. The child/toddler play tent is a really strong item for skill building, and also works as a bed. (A bed immune to annoying monsters, no less!) The sectional sofas look fantastic, however they do not have comfort. The separated stove tops and ovens are a really fantastic addition. A few pieces of the generic clutter are well suited to any and every home.

Some of the CAS items are modeled extremely poorly, especially the shoes. They look very poor quality, and do not match the usual model size or textures in the game. However the accessories are decent.

I have not gotten to use the Interior Decorator career much yet because it is a bit fickle. While I do enjoy decorating and building, the career did not feel great. Similarly, the like/dislike category of Decor is not very well implemented. Sims will sometimes go far out of their way to applaud or complain about a piece of furniture, and what category pieces have been assigned to from other packs can be VERY arbitrary.",Recommended

3562,나의 드림하우스 게임팩 리뷰,"Now, before I begin I'm going to give a little bit of information about the perspective that I have. This pack is very divisive, because it has a focus on a very particular part of gameplay; room or house renovation. Sims 4's gameplay as a whole hasn't gripped me in the same way that it did in Sims 3- I don't tend to play the same household for generations. What this pack brings you is specifically renovating a space after coming into a small burst of simoleons.

My expectations were very low after reading a couple of reviews that came out pre-release that slammed some of the bugs that this pack could provide. I use a very large amount of CC and am already prone to instability, so I braced myself for the absolute worst. What I got, however, was a pleasant surprise. I can go to jobs, perform all of the interactions, and complete renovations with little-to-none dropped commands or bugged sims.

The new taste system is interesting yet painfully simple. It feels like wasted potential within the context of the new career, where only 3 factors from a household can be taken into account on a job. The ""room renovation"" is extremely unclear and desperately needs some kind of specificity in larger homes, but does provide freedom. The way you filter styles and traits for furniture when renovating is clunky, and I'm incredibly disappointed that they don't allow you to filter by these traits in normal gameplay. I do miss having favorite colors though, that was really nice. Where's favorite food?

I enjoy putting together rooms, re-imagining spaces, and challenging myself to tie together items that otherwise would have no business going into the same room. It makes me want to play one sim for a while, and really flesh out their home and life in turn. I shouldn't compliment this pack for bringing back features that I'm pretty sure should have been there in the first place, but I am happy with the new career it provides.

FURNITURE, FURNITURE, FURNITURE!!!
This pack has some of the best neutral furniture items. The new furniture set it comes with that's rounded? I could cry it's so cute. I was going to talk more about how cool the furniture in the pack was but I have come to realize that I haven't used any of it in any builds so...

Anyway I like it, buy at your own risk.",Recommended

It's not worth the $20 right now. With only being able to use the furniture, it's only worth about $10 at the moment. Either wait for a sale or a bug fix update!",Not Recommended
3567,나의 드림하우스 게임팩 리뷰,"I can definitively say that this DLC is worth adding to your collection if you like the style. I'd alternatively call it an ""Ikea"" pack, as the items to me, fit that category of decorating. Underwhelming sure, but it is The Sims 4.

Gameplay-wise it is comparable to The Sims 3 Ambitions DLC where you can become an interior designer. It is a fun career if you enjoy playing around with home interiors but unless you take it seriously the game doesn't have an appropriate ai to judge whichever makeover you complete. You can of course just place a bunch of toilets in the living room to satisfy the client's desire for ""white"". As well I feel it is a step back from The Sims 3 version where there is no checklist of needing 1 toilet, 1 shower, etc. to complete that project. One benefit of this active career is that you can choose to send your sim off to work without even being there for days you want to focus on other members of the family.

Stuff-wise, there are a lot of decent items from lights, to kitchen cabinets, chairs, and beds, but the style itself is similar to that of The Sims 4 Tiny living. It's beautiful a bit 50's in style, but it is one style. You can see in the screenshots attached that all the items are fit to this one theme. The color choices are limited to a point it feels like you are supposed to pick and choose a certain palette for your room.



Overall this DLC is lovely because I love the style, but career-wise it is very much a niche. If the items are your ideal style for builds paired with Tiny Living and even Snowy Escape, then this DLC is for you.

EA likes their kits and now 800$ over for the collection, it opens your eyes to other possible games in the future as an affordable replacement to this.",Recommended

3569,나의 드림하우스 게임팩 리뷰,"If you love to build and have been waiting to use all your build mode cc : this is THE pack. It's a little glitchy right now, and not very straight forward. It took me at least an hour to figure out how to stop failing. And not until I read the reviews here did I learn that you're supposed to build where they lead you! I've just been building wherever but I guess I've figured out the like/dislike system enough to get away with it with pretty swell success.

Here's a tip: Rely on the family's sims profiles as MUCH as the job quest menu. Ask everyone in the house their favorite colors, their preferred decor style, and their hobbies. You can use those things to use as back up deco for extra points. What the job menu picks will be the most important (i think? lol) though and if a client asks for furniture you don't have a lot of you can try and persuade them to change their mind on the decor style requested in the main job quest menu(?). Same with color. This has saved me as well if sims pick conflicting things that end up on the job menu (ie: one sim loved yellow and one sim hated yellow.)

When you show off items pick items to show off you know matched the clients preferences, don't be shy to show off more than 3 things :)

But besides that I love playing this pack and coming back to clients and remodeling a world room by room and getting paid to do it! If you've ever sat and build your own world from scratch multiple times in newcrest just to see sims interact with the place, this pack is for you....BUT you may want to wait a few patches and heck it might be on sale by then :)",Recommended
3570,나의 드림하우스 게임팩 리뷰,"Absolutely don't buy it yet! Maybe not for awhile! If you love the build items- it is all suuuuuuper cute, but, it's not worth the entire $20. The gameplay is what we're all excited for, and it is currently pretty unplayable.

I bought this despite the recommendation of others in the sims community, it is riddled with bugs. You might not immediately notice them, but they usually appear about 2-6 hours into gameplay. The update meant to support this DLC broke curtains and a few hair pieces from the fitness pack.

On your first gig, pay attention to where the first sim takes you! Don't try to start talking to the clients until you've figured out which room you're supposed to renovate.

Personally, my first gig went horribly. It vaguely says 'room reno' and I figured, hey, it is giving me freedom and I get to pick a room. Wrong! You're supposed to follow where they kind of lead your sim, which I don't remember them ever taking me outside to the patio, for some reason we went through the backdoor, the husband lead me upstairs and the wife went past me to go to the patio, but, whatever. I think I just got a weirdly rotated house and maybe normally it isn't so confusing. Nowhere does it tell you which room you're supposed to renovate. Later, it starts to just say 'bedroom' reno but there are multiple bedrooms usually! There needs to be a clearer indicator because if you do the wrong room your time is wasted, your work performance goes down, and you don't get paid.

Also, idk if the gig description says anything significant since its not viewable later, but there really isn't a story to this pack. I kinda thought you'd have a goal, kind of like house flipper where you're told a little story like 'granny moved out and we need something modern'. In HF, it gives you a specific list of colors and items for the job and you slowly reveal the vision your client had for the reno. It is very cool. Here, the trailer claims that you need to find like a solution since the toddler is running around through their bedroom. You also had the option of being chaotic and doing something horrible they just have to live with. Either way- none of that happens.

Actually, the way you're supposed to do it is kinda stupid. You have to go in and talk to the sims, ask them what theyre looking for, and their likes and dislikes pop up. It isn't guarenteed to give you much to go on. You might get 'hates black, hates fitness, hates green'. For, like, a bedroom? So you just build pretty much whatever you feel like. I'm pretty sure if you tried to change the walls right now anyways, they're bugged.

But the like/dislike system is kinda annoying here. If it guarentted something useful that they like? Like at least tell me their favorite color (i know you can chat with the client outside of the decorator interactions and ask, but, kinda stupid to have to do it that way) and/or a style of decor that they like. Not dislike. If I ever just get three hobbies they hate I'm gonna riot.",Not Recommended

3572,나의 드림하우스 게임팩 리뷰,"First off, if you're a Simmer that likes to download Pre-Fab/Furnished Lots and Rooms into your Sim world, this pack may be hard to swallow for you especially for the price. It's a career mode with tons of build mode stuff. You don't get another World or extra lots. You have to CAS from an existing lot or change one of your Sim's career. But if you're the type of Simmer that likes to build Lots/Rooms that are unfurnished to start from scratch, this is an AWESOME pack. 3 hours in, my Sim has already designed and built a living room and a bathroom for people in my Sim world that needed a revamp. From greeting the customers to seeing how happy my Simmers were after the build was pretty cool. It's definately not the same as the Get to Work DLC. The gigs keep on stacking up and your reputation builds up fast too. I would suggest if you plan to start this career, make sure to choose someone that is outgoing, a genius, and not have mischief, or negative moods as the client's customer will not like the interaction. That alone will hinder your reputation. Otherwise, this is a very good pack. You''ll spend tons of time with this Career.",Recommended
3573,나의 드림하우스 게임팩 리뷰,"I was very excited to play this pack, as I think it offers a good replayable content as well as amazing new furniture.

The new career is also quite interesting, and because of the new likes and dislikes I believe it won't get as boring as like with the other active careers.
Although I have only played it for only a little while, during my two gigs I didn't get payed because they didn't like it. I will continue to play more and since I was never much of a builder I am interested in learning more about designing rooms/houses.

Update: Something that helped me get positive feedback on the gigs is asking the sims about their favorite color, style and hobby outside of the work options. It gives me more information that I can work with, because I sometimes only get their dislikes at the job.

3580,욕실용품 키트 리뷰,"I was originally pretty excited for this kit. The items looked really useful even though there weren't many of them.

Well ... I regret spending $5 on this.

The textures and meshes are VERY low quality, meaning everything looks blurry and blocky, and looks like it's out of a game from 15 years ago! On top of that, the objects aren't even sized well.

The items are decorative only, and don't have any functionality. While that's typical of the kits, it's a little disappointing. To compare - things in the Everyday Clutter kit were things like glasses, post-its, mugs, a tote, etc. They aren't things your sim would typically interact much with. Even so, in that kit, we got a new functional speaker!
The items in the Bathroom Clutter kit are things you interact with daily, even multiple times a day. Light switches, toothbrushes, a razor, a hair dryer, etc. And none of them do anything ...

I'd heard we were supposed to get a couple light switches in this kit and one in the base game patch that came right before the release ... I still haven't seen that base game light switch.

The kit doesn't come with very many items, and it's thematically similar to the Everyday Clutter kit we just got a few months ago. Yes, there are 31 items, which is about standard for a kit - but I think it's the (lack of) variety in the items that makes it feel like less.
We get two rugs, the same organizer drawer twice - just with clutter and without, the tame hanging towels twice - one neat and one messy, the same toothpaste tube twice - one full and one mostly empty, a toilet paper on the wall and a free-standing roll, two light switches, some lotion standing up and some lotion lying down.
Then we get a stack of towels, a shower caddy, a hand soap dispenser, a toothbrush cup, and a tray of items that are all similar to existing items from either the base game or other packs.

I actually really like having a ""messy"" and a ""neat"" version of the same item! It's just that so many of the items feel like duplicates, plus the low quality - it really feels like this should've been part of the Everyday Clutter kit, and because it's not, it feels like it's just a half-done attempt to get more money out of players.",Not Recommended

3600,꼬마 멋쟁이 키트 리뷰,"Not really enough reviews here and so I decided to make a review as well. It has cute items for children where at least some packs have very little if anything CaS related for child sims, but only recommended if you like playing with child sims/family gameplay. It is not necessarily a ""must have"" pack, but overall I like it.",Recommended
3601,꼬마 멋쟁이 키트 리뷰,Great clothing for your child sims. Also gives the realistic comfy clothing look. Also makes the child sims look so cute. Also great since children don't have that good of outfits.,Recommended
3602,꼬마 멋쟁이 키트 리뷰,"These clothing models (/textures) are notably higher quality than a significant amount of the children's clothing in this game. I wasn't sure about this kit when I bought it, but due to the higher model quality the pieces in this immediately started to dominate my Sim children's wardrobes.

The down side is they are mostly in pastel colors, with a lot of ugly camo patterns. Even the black swatches are really just grey. But Sim child clothing leaves a LOT to be desired in general, so this is still an improvement.",Recommended

Second off it would give me bits and pieces of stuff I had not had before like I never had the hotdog suite before, but it gave me it, so I am thinking that its downloading some of the stuff but not all of the stuff.

3620,그런지 스타일 키트 리뷰,"The items in this kit while not completely accurate to the bands of the 90's are still great. I was a little on the fence at first because I felt like it was hard to make full outfits with just the kit itself but once I added it to werewolves and high school it really began to shine. If you want punky teens and rebellious youths and young adults on the run from the strong arm of the law this is the pack you'll find yourself going to again and again for bits and pieces to add to other outfits. I really love it and think it's great quality for the money.

I still wish there were a few more plaid shirts with a little more rumple and wear to them, but that's just me, as an actual 90's kid trying to recapture my rapidly fading youth before I turn into a pile of dust.",Recommended
3621,그런지 스타일 키트 리뷰,"I personally ❤️ this kit, however, I acknowledge that for most people it probably is not worth it (like all kits except Blooming Rooms). If you’re not really into retro/grunge styles, then I’d suggest saving your money and putting it towards a stuff pack that comes with actual gameplay (the stuff packs aren’t even that much more expensive than the kits on sale anyway)",Not Recommended
3622,그런지 스타일 키트 리뷰,"I appreciate this kit, since they're mostly clothes that I would actually wear irl!
Of course, it's only clothes. So It's 100% up to you if you think it's worth it.",Recommended
3623,그런지 스타일 키트 리뷰,"I don't know what fashion idiot thinks this represent the ""grunge"" style but they need to be fired from the Sims team asap.
These few outfits you get are Impracticable and ugly just like the runway models people make fun of online.
you know - like those artists trends that you will probably NEVER see any sane human being wear.

I grew up with actual grunge style hard rock and gritty styles and these are insulting to that sense of style. The (VERY FEW) outfits you get are just a colab of terrible looking trends that I've never seen anyone ever wear. Maybe a few of the hoodies could pass but they still give you like only a few color schemes. There are a few tats and other cosmetics that also look ok but initially I regret paying a full 5$ for this terrible ""dlc"" addition.

It really seems like almost every dlc sims pump out I regret buying.

Maybe I just should stop playing sims",Not Recommended
3624,그런지 스타일 키트 리뷰,Just buy actual clothes.,Not Recommended
3625,그런지 스타일 키트 리뷰,"These pieces are really nicely textured, and a great addition to the ""Rocker"" clothing category in the game. They fit very well with a lot of the other ""Rocker"" clothes from other packs (especially Realm of Magic and Werewolves), making this very helpful for creating a larger variety of outfits.

This may not fit real grunge fashion. But it does fit the game's broad ""Rocker"" category very well that encompasses punk, goth, rock, grunge, etc - And there is accordingly a dash of something for anything that would fit under that in here.",Recommended
3626,그런지 스타일 키트 리뷰,"After full analysis of the 25 piece kit I concluded the sims team doesn't know what ""grunge"" is. My only incentive to sacrifice my ill gotten gains of $5 was new tats, jewelry, and a few clothing items that were passable. These kits need to drop to $2 given the mid-low offerings.",Not Recommended

3639,카니발 스트리트웨어 키트 리뷰,"Aside from what it's designed for, this kit does have some neutral swatches on most items that make them more generically useful. Even combined with more toned down items, this kit is definitely more for party outfits and Sims with a lot of personality.

You won't be disappointed if you like what you see on the previews, but you also probably already know if this kit is for you or not. The clothing in it is very loud, and not likely to appeal to everyone.",Recommended

I would overall not recommend this kit pack and especially not as one of your first kit packs. Some of the CaS items look interesting and cute that I might use with my sims, but I also do not think that this is one of the better CaS kit packs either and I would basically compare this to custom content, except for that it is not free. The only CaS kit pack worse than this pack currently is Modern Menswear.",Not Recommended

PROS:
No price tag
You can even use winter holiday decorations at other times of year

CONS:
Isn't as game-changing (literally) as the DLC packs you have to pay for (though that makes sense)

3928,우리집 셰프 아이템 팩 리뷰,"The first Sims 4 DLC that might actually be worth the price!!!
I bought this pack for the new appliances and didn't really expect to do much actual food selling. But I've just started playing with it and I can't believe how much I love it.

Other packs have stands that you can sell from, but with those stands you have to stand there tending the stand and doing nothing else. And if you have more than one stand, or have a sim busking nearby or anything, the customers get kinda confused and you get a huge drop in sales as they aren't spending their time buying from you.

But with the home chef hustle stand:
- You can multitask. It has two spots for small portable appliances so you can cook while you sell. But there's also a 2x3square area that your sim can interact with, so you can actually put another kitchen bench/counter next to it and have even more cooking going on. You can even feed/care for infants/toddlers while you tend the stall, if they're within the 2x3 square space.

- You don't need to interact with the customers at all if you don't want to. It's so much easier than a retail store.

- You can place and tend multiple stalls during the same food sale, and customers will buy from all the stalls. Which means you could set up a food market.

- Nothing seems to distract customers from your stall. A sim can be busking nearby, there can be music to dance to, you can even set up and run a food sale on a retail lot while it's open for business. Nothing I've done has distracted the customers.

- You can also use MoveObjects to place a fence through the stall, preventing customers from coming around to use your appliances by simply fencing yourself in. And the stand is functional like this.

- Despite being called a food stall, and the sale being called a food sale, you can sell non-food items. Pretty much anything that can go in your inventory can be sold from the food stall, and you can mix-and-match all you like, it doesn't just have to be all food or all non-food items.",Recommended

3938,우리집 셰프 아이템 팩 리뷰,"This pack was not kidding about the hustle! Selling food with the new table is very active, a bit demanding, but pretty fun.

The waffles are an easy crowd pleaser (with fun options and models!), however the waffle maker glitches out a lot. I wasn't expecting anything great out of the stand mixer, but its bonuses are actually really fantastic! So I was surprised to like that one. Of course, it's much more helpful when you're doing a lot of cooking instead of just meals for a sim or two.

The aspiration for cooking with the appliances is nice. It has a useful, if slightly niche, but not OP reward trait, and is easy to complete.
The aspiration for money from selling with the new table is a nightmare. It has multiple obscure / strange objectives, which cap off with requiring you to revive a ghost back to life through selling ambrosia on the table. That goal alone is horrible to do for a lot of reasons (from potential insufficient ghosts in a save, to NPCs you want to remain ghosts).

This pack, while enjoyable, is by no means a general must have. There's nothing that is going to drastically change or improve general gameplay. However it is considerably better than Dine Out, for a vaguely similar concept, so I will recommend this pack over that one.",Recommended

The only bug I've encountered so far is not being able to use the mailbox that my sim made, but she made a nice profit selling it on Plopsy anyway. 10/10 do not regret adding this to my game.",Recommended
3965,뚝딱뚝딱 뜨개질 아이템 팩 리뷰,"Easily one of the best Stuff Packs - Knitting and Metal! Something for everyone! \m/

Metal is the only music station with entirely custom dialogue for interactions, and it is completely on point.

Knitting has a lot of depth and a WEALTH of objects and clothing to create. Your Sims can teach other Sims to knit, and the animations for it are fantastic. Children can knit. You can knit baby clothing, so you can redress your baby. The knitting aspiration feels really good to complete and repeat; The objectives feel like you've done something, without being too tedious. The wool from Cottage Living llamas works with knitting. Knitting is a 10/10 way to earn Emotional Control for children/teens, and/or Emotionally Mindful for a quick Emotion Surge.

Most of the CAS is locked behind knitting, but all of it (locked and not) is very nice. Same with the BB, most needs to be crafted with knitting, but all of the items are really nice. The items that don't need crafted are well suited to any ""craftsy"" Sim, regardless of if they knit or not. Also, rocking chairs!

About the only negative in this pack is that Plopsy is useless. It's very poor at selling your items, and because of the low list prices for items, the listing fee, and the initial crafting cost, you usually won't make a profit. Unfortunately this is the only way to sell your knitted items - However you can gift them for some nice sentiments!",Recommended

If you don't own Get to Work it's a much more realistic way to sell crafted items. It's not limited to knitted items; you can sell photos, paintings, cross stitch hoops etc. on Plopsy.

Compared to many other packs and expansions it's relatively bug free. Sometimes the Sims can't route to the rocking chair when they have to resume their knitting. I just let them finish their work on the couch and start a new knitting project on the rocking chair after that. Recommended but I would say just wait for a sale anyway.",Recommended

Somehow I really love it though. The pieces fit nicely together, both style-wise and in how they physically skooch up nicely together. I use it in almost every build where I want to do a patio area or have an outside witchy area that doesn't reek of victorian-era charlatan. It's simple and minimalist without looking extremely uncomfortable or being boring AF. I like that there are matching swatches across ALL of the pieces, unlike some build sets, so you can build a really visually cohesive area.

I love the giant 3 tile window, I love the awning thing, and I love the open patio door, because they're all pieces that aren't already obviously in the game or are serous improvements over similar pieces.

The wall & floor swatches are also great for outdoor areas or basements or other areas where you just need something neutral with a little bit of texture to it, without being overbearing or too glarey in high-noon light.

The only think I think it needs is a bar counter set to elongate the bar, but i might just make CC of this myself, because that wouldn't be very hard. I might also make a more blocky minimalist barstool, because the supplied ones look a tad wicker-ey for me and are the least cohesive of the pieces.

I got this for free because I owned the base game. Loads of people are QQing because they think this a poor compensation for everyone who paid for the base game over the previous SEVEN YEARS, but seriously, the game is 7 years old. Get over it.

4041,화려한 사막 키트 리뷰,"...and all I got was this lousy DLC

In celebration of Sims 4 becoming free, players could redeem this Kit for themselves for free and I can only say that the DLC leaves a lot to be desired.

The DLC includes a good handful of furniture that overall are good looking and best of all versatile. I personally really like the building pieces and they seem to be thought out and designed quite well. However some of the furniture pieces are duplicates of others, just in slightly different variations or sizes.

But paying 5€ for a Kit? Better save your money and wait for absolutely insane sales. You're better off downloading Custom Content from modders and creators. Or if you have money to spare you might want to commission or find a way to support said creators monetarily. You can get way more and way more interesting content for free.",Not Recommended

4123,모던 맨즈웨어 키트 리뷰,"Some of the outfits are really cute on women, but modeled horribly. Instead of planning for both male and female sims to use them, they half-arsed the modeling for fem sims. Which is a shame as they're soooo cute otherwise. Yes, I'm aware it says Modern Menswear, but everyone can wear them. Only one frame actually had any effort put into it, though. Female sims will end up having weird triangle breasts and odd waists.

As for male sims... Some of the outfits aren't bad, but others are just impractical and odd. Like one set of pants that has some odd layering to look like shorts over pants but not actually shorts over pants :| I saw another review that mentioned it's more like stuff you'd see on the fashion runway and I agree. Some works well, others don't.

I don't regret picking it up, however. Just bummed about what I posted :) There's always hoping they'll one day fix the chest pieces, but I doubt it. At least the crotch of the pants don't hang down to your thighs on this set! I hit yes on recommend because it's 4.99 and I'll get my money out of it in use. But it's very subjective.

4133,나의 결혼이야기 게임팩 리뷰,"With this game pack getting so many negative reviews I was wondering if I should even give it a try, but now that I have it, I'm actually enjoying it a lot.

The main selling point for the pack is weddings, but now that I've given it a playthrough for a while, I think that's selling it short, because you get a lot more stuff than just weddings, and I think that this other stuff easily makes this pack worth it even if you aren't that interested in weddings.

Tbh I primarily bought it for the world. Tartosa is beautiful and fun to play in. I like to go on vacations with my sims, and Tartosa is a great vacation spot. Porto Luminoso is a cute little town with several beaches (they aren't as gorgeous as Sulani's, but still very pretty and your sims can have a good time swimming and sunbathing and making sandcastles). The town itself has a variety of stores where you can buy wedding related goodies (or not, if the stores are closed, which they often are, which, realistic honestly). The whole thing is very quaint. You get several beautiful premade lots (the Old Nectary in particular really gets the Mediterranean vibe IMO) as well as several empty but scenic looking spots to build on. In the Porto Luminoso neighbourhood you can stroll through the town, in the other one you get more of a park/natural landscape with waterfalls and a few scenic spots your sims can walk to. Lots of pretty good photo/screenshot opportunities if that's your thing. If you have Seasons, the weather seems to be warm and sunny for the majority of the year from what I saw (in case you want to do a vacation to escape the cold and rain for example).

In terms of gameplay, first of course you get a lot more wedding related activities. You can now go to buy wedding cakes, bouquets and clothes with your sims, you get new socials where you can ask your friends to fill in some roles at your wedding (sims of honour, officiant etc). There is a lot to do and if you actually want to do all of it it'll keep you right busy for a while. (You can also just not do any of that if you find it tedious btw. But there really is a lot to do so if you're looking for gameplay stuff that'll keep you busy for a bit that's definitely there.)

Additionally, I was honestly really surprised how much more than weddings you get? In your calendar, you get a new category of events to add, titled Wedding Events. This category contains several different types of social events your sims can host now, the actual wedding of course, but also things like ""family dinner"" and ""bach party"". All of these events function more like the Seasons holidays than basegame events, aka you get a couple of event activities to choose from and can thus make up your own event with activities you like. This is a very flexible system, and if you're creative with it you can get a lot of fun out of it. I played like, one wedding, which was fun and worked as intended, but I've been hosting several family dinners and other parties since, because while they are called wedding events and intended to be done in preparation of a wedding, no wedding is required to host them, they're separate events you can very well host on their own. A ""family dinner"" doesn't need to be family, you can invite friends and whoever else you want, and it doesn't have to be a dinner. My sims held a summer garden party with cold drinks and muffins earlier today that was technically a family dinner. If you stop seeing the events as parts of a wedding preparation and instead use them as stand-alones, you get a handful of different, customisable social events you can do.

A good indicator if this pack is for you might be if you enjoy the clubs and partying gameplay of Get Together and if you like the holidays from Seasons. If you like those, you'll probably enjoy the various ""wedding"" events, because they're kinda a mix of those.

Other things you get:
- new group dances that are different than the dances from Get Together
- slow dancing for couples (very cute and romantic and definitely something I thought was missing from dancing as an activity in Get Together)
- a lot of formal wear, the majority of which is wedding dresses of course, but also formal clothes from a variety of cultures which are fun if you're looking to make a more diverse population for your world IMO
- some new jewellery
- build mode items for fancy parties (decorated tents and trellis, fancy tables and chairs, and decorations) that will also work if you're building a high class restaurant maybe or an exclusive lounge or want to furnish a castle or something

I feel like I'm gonna get a lot more gameplay out of this pack than others I also own in this price range, so, yeah, recommended. If you like socialising with your sims, it's a fun pack that can do a lot more than get your sims married.",Recommended

You will make get 10% of your guests showing up if you're lucky and the sims of honour, ringer bearer, flower sim, and officiant won't show up a lot of the time, maybe one out of the five, two if you get lucky. There are some cute features but it's very broken and EA is never going to fix it. They've put out a few ""fixes"" over the years that have slightly improved it, but nothing substantial.

4138,나의 결혼이야기 게임팩 리뷰,"I was so afraid of buying this pack because of all the negative reviews. But finally I bought this on sale and I'm positively surprised! :) Here are my experiences with this pack:

This pack works fine. No bugs. Here is a great tip that I found from Reddit and what made me finally try this pack:
You have to turn off the autonomy of your sims from game settings so wedding and other parties which came with this pack will work properly. I haven't had any issues after turning autonomy off.

BUT for example wedding don't have a time limit like other parties do. So you don't know how much time you have before the event will be over. You'll always get a bronze award (even if your wedding was perfect) but you don't get any reward. So I'm not sure if these wedding themed parties are not supposed to have golden, silver and bronze awards like other parties do or is this a bug? But it's still fun to have these new parties that came with this pack.

Here are some other nice new stuff that I liked in this pack:

The new world Tartosa is beautiful.
Now you can dance slow dances together with other sims.
You can buy cute tea sets and serve tea.
Different kinds of wedding cakes. (I have Get to work DLC, too, so it's fun to create a bakery and sell cute wedding cakes.)

I recommend to buy this on sale. Even if you are not so interested in wedding stuff this pack brings some other cool new stuff to the game. Of course I can't promise you won't encounter any bugs but you can refund this pack if it doesn't work.
(I refunded Dine out DLC back then when it was too buggy to play, Steam allowed the refund)
I haven't used any mods in Sims 4 but still some players who don't use mods are encountering bugs in this pack. To me nothing game breaking happened after downloading this.",Recommended

4140,나의 결혼이야기 게임팩 리뷰,"I saw the negative reviews and honestly hoped by this time all the bugs were fixed and that I could leave a positive review... however they are still incredibly relevant today.

1. I created a beautiful wedding venue complete with chairs lining an isle, but was told I could not complete 'walking down the isle' due to none being on the lot..

2. When you gather people around for an event and try to make the B&G dance or cut the cake they will not do it, they will instead go do something completely different and you have to constantly cancel what they want to do and click to dance multiple times before it goes ahead. One sim will stand for the dance and the other sim will be like... ""man I want some cake"" and while I can totally relate, this made for a crappy, frustrating experience.

3. None of my guests watched the wedding.

4. throughout the wedding the groom changed into his normal everyday wear at least 10 times... including right before he exchanged vows. leaving a beautiful bride in a wedding dress and and everyday dude.

5. The cake shop was a great idea but I put my cake in the fridge to store if for the hours before the event and my sims ate it as soon as it was in there despite not being hungry... also can relate...

6. asking someone to be a bridesmaid or flower girl is great - apart from the fact that you HAVE TO ask the person before planning the event, so while I knew the flower girl/ring bearer I had to x the event, travel to see the sims, ask them and then plan the event. this shouldn't be so constrictive.

7. not being able to hire a mixologist/ caterer / entertainer for the event really sucked which is probably why they all just stood around and ate cake while the wedding was happening.

all up a sucky experience - trust the negative reviews...",Not Recommended
4141,나의 결혼이야기 게임팩 리뷰,"First of all, the wedding works for me but not so much, so I'm fine with it.. but I still don't recommend that much tho especially it's still not working for most simmers. Cas are amazing ngl, they did a great job there, but most lgbt swatches don't match that much at all and I find it ugly.. that's not a nice way to represent lgbt community. Bbs are great ngl, I love the Mediterranean style bbs, it also works well for coastal builds. The world is probably the major salepoint here as it's so beautiful and large for a game pack, sure it's quite empty but there's a lot sceneries for your sims to propose. The major gameplay here is literally in the pack name, which is wedding, it doesn't really work well and it's broken and it's been TWO YEARS and the problem is still there. Don't get this if u want a working wedding party, we most likely will never have it fixed. I don't think you will pay it just for cas, bbs and world while it breaks the wedding party.

Check out the many places where you can see a full item list, but I've been thoroughly delighted by this pack.

The party events except for the wedding ceremony are fun I really enjoyed them.

Then came the ceremony. Of course I tried out the venue that comes with Tartosa world. It was entirely unenjoyable. Calling your wedding guests to activities locks them into standing there, and even if said activity has been done they are still locked in and I had Judith Ward wet herself as I was trying to get the First dance in. I'm playing an extreme start legacy and my neighbours are celebs, they kept distracting other guests. I had Thorn bailey officate and candy kept squeeling right where the bride and groom stand! The guests are so loud during exchange of vows. Cutting the cake was ok until the guests just stand there watching you eat it and don't do anything, again locked into the ""Ceremony activity"" summon interaction. Not enough chairs in the venue either.. I may try one more time in a custom arrangement like in my home. Sims walk down the very short aisle at full speed it lasts half a second. If you have more sims than chairs they sit in the aisle.

I'll be getting the script mod to enable base game weddings again for sure.. such a shame the venue is really beautiful it had a lot of potential but the interactions just don't work. Also, while engaged the ""Ask to officiate, ask to be sim of honor"" interactions pushing to the front during conversations is so annoying, even if you've already asked someone they don't go away until you get married.

My reasons :
1. At the first release, this DLC was so buggy
2. After ""they fixed it"" in some updates, the wedding-related interaction STILL BROKEN
3. SIms official, honor, ring-bearer, and blahblablah are useless
4. The Wedding-Related social events even too pricy in simoleons, my newly-wed sims went broke after threw some wed-related parties
5. The cringe ""rainbow""ed theme that too push forward among this pack

This DLC indeed disappointed so many players, I dont know what's on EA's mind. Maybe they just wanna statisfying The Alphabet Cummunity by creating this cringed content. ironically many alphabet people got disappointed & angered with this garbage pack.

This DLC is absolutely unplayable, stay away from it if you want it for it's purpose, the wedding stories.

On sale it might be worth it for the pretty world and some CAS/build stuff, but trying to get my Sims married was the most stressful, annoying, bug-ridden experience I've ever had with the Sims - note, this is after the first big patch, the one that should've fixed a lot like the wedding cakes and all. Don't fall for it, even if you manage to place your wedding cake you can be sure someone eats from it in the utter chaos that is you trying to get married before you can cut the first piece - my bride even managed to eat from it before the whole event, when the cake was already marked for the wedding and shouldn't even be in her inventory.
Otherwise, prepare for guests and couple peeing theirselves, walking away for a nap, getting drunk at the bar while you try everything to keep everyone at the aisle.
The worst part is, this utter mess completely replaces the event from the base game, so there's no going back unless you disable the DLC completely.

From past experience, I doubt this will ever be playable, Maxis is already working on the next 3 packs instead of fixing anything from the old ones. It's really sad because the basic ideas are always nice and cute and could be worth it if they worked as supposed, but nothing ever gets fixed with the Sims. :(",Not Recommended

They just put heavily wooded areas where there could be more residential lots. I also wish the ""town"" area was actually made of editable lots.

4167,나의 결혼이야기 게임팩 리뷰,"Alright. Before I go any further, please know that the recommendation ONLY APPLIES IF THIS PACK IS ON SALE. Otherwise yeah, its an atrocious ripoff.

Now for context, I quite enjoy The Sims 4, despite my love for The Sims 3. I acknowledge it has its faults, but Steam reviews are often jokes or just incessant whining with no real helpful thoughts so I'm attempting to review every piece of DLC for The Sims 4. Every pack I own was bought on sale, admittedly, except for this one.

My Wedding Stories is an interesting pack. I don't think it deserves all the hate it receives--this is a very straightforward pack that just serves to flesh out weddings. Which is something I didn't think we really *needed* but what are you gonna do? No, it doesn't add a ton of side content. No careers, no new skills to my knowledge. Just a few new mechanics for weddings and the new world--which is great, I must say. Honestly without the new world this is essentially a stuff pack for double the price. But even then some of the stuff packs have added more than this did.

PROS:

- A plethora of CAS items, most of which are extremely nice. The variety of wedding dresses is staggering--I even found one that resembles my own wife's wedding dress.

- New and far more interesting steps towards marriage--Now you can have bachelor/bachelorette parties, rehearsal dinners, engagement parties, and then the wedding!

- Other people in your Sim's life now have the opportunities to be named sim of honor, flower girl, officiator, and more. This allows for deeper storytelling and a greater sense of emotional connection to the other sims in the world.

- Weddings can have specially chosen customs and goals that reflect different cultures, and best of all its all up to you.

- Venues now matter much more than they did before. If you want to have a wedding with specific goals, you must ensure the venue has the appropriate furnishings.


CONS:

- Granted, I have not played through a wedding more than once, so my experience is limited. But from what I've seen the entire process of weddings is a little buggy. Sims just don't do what theyre told, or do what theyre told once and then never do what theyre told again.

- Because of the speed at which time passes and how long it takes for sims to do literally anything, weddings easily take upwards of 12 full hours from the start of the ceremony, to the dance, to the dinner, to the cutting of the cake. This is frustrating to say the least, and will inevitably lead to every sim there peeing themselves or going hungry or passing out. The only major venue for weddings is in the new town, and only has two bathrooms. Many sims peed themselves on my sim's wedding day. Makes it difficult to maintain immersion when everyone in the background looks like they rolled around in sewage.

- Complete and utter lack of tutorilization or ANY kind of communication from the game means that once you get to the venue for the wedding, it can be difficult to get things rolling. I had selected someone as officiator, but they died close to the wedding because it was Vladislaus Straud and he soaked in a little too much sun. I selected a new officiator, but could NOT get them to officiate the wedding. My sims had to end up just exchanging vows by themselves. Did I do something wrong? Was it too late to get a new officiator? Was it a bug? Did I not do things in the correct order? WE'LL NEVER KNOW BECAUSE THE GAME DOES NOT PROPERLY COMMUNICATE WITH YOU ABOUT NEW MECHANICS!

- While the clothing options for women were great, the male selection is straight up shameful. I was hoping for different cuts on suits, or more variations of color. I like business casual so I was hoping for simple colors in suits and shirts but some ties that really contrasted and popped. But no. This packs focuses almost solely on the more feminine side of things, which is a shame because the male fashion has been lacking severely when it comes to formal settings.

- Some sims straight up refuse requests to have specific roles in your wedding. My sim had a daughter that he asked to be flower girl and she refused three times despite having high relationship with my sim and his soon-to-be wife. Why? STILL DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THE GAME WON'T TELL ME

- There is definitely a soft limit to how many sims you can invite to the wedding. There simply is not enough seating, or the rooms are too small and get cramped quickly. Plus the ""do whatever"" nature of non player-controlled sims means they'll constantly get out of their seat for no reason.So even if you have enough seating for the ceremony or dinner, it won't necessarily matter.


Overall, the pack IS fun, if everything works decently. I had fun with the parties leading up to the wedding, and selecting the different roles and goals for the wedding itself. Once we got there, it was a mess and didn't work as well as it should have. But I still managed to have fun. Just wish they gave the masculine side a bit more attention and communicated with the player better. Do I recommend it? I guess, yeah. But ONLY on sale! Otherwise you're better off just purchasing some other pack. Highly recommend Get Famous and Vampires",Recommended

#2: I really wish Sims would listen when you ask them to sit or walk down the isle.
#3: they fixed the cake issue but it was annoying having cake rot in 4 hours rather than 8.

So i will start off by being candid. I'm happy i got this pack. I am happy because the items are cute. I love all the different wedding cakes. And i love love.

But when asked if one should buy this pack? No. Not unless, like me, you have money to spare.

your weddings will be more functional WITHOUT the pack, even if you have less pretty aesthetic. With my wedding stories, getting sims to do what you want is even MORE of a hassle, which is saying something. They don't do anything. The amount of time you spend trying to get them to do anything is enough to make it so they all need to pee, or sleep. Some random sim stole my wedding cake. At another wedding one of the grooms straight up left, and so did the sims of honor, who i had to invite back onto the lot manually. By that time the groom wasn't even recognised as such anymore and wouldn't stand at the arch.

This pack is broken and it's shameful they released it as it is. I have been tolerant of EA's practices for a long time, yet they lost even me with this one.

-Cutting the cake interaction doesn't work

-Officiant and sims of honor may show up late or not at all
-Officiant interactions do not work at all
-Flower Pal and Ring Bearer interactions were not even available for me during the wedding
-""Put ring on spouse"" interaction didn't work and then disappeared

-""Throw Rice"" interaction will sometimes have sims throwing rice at random objects instead of the couple
-If you hired a bartender/caterer or pianist/DJ for your wedding they may not show up

So the My Wedding Stories Game Pack is good, except for the whole wedding part.

look up people playing it before buying, you might find use in the CAS and build mode stuff, you might also love the world, but until the weddings are debugged, you can't do a wedding.

So if you don't do weddings and you like the other stuff included it can be for you, but it's sad that the wedding pack is only good for those who don't like weddings.

4194,나의 결혼이야기 게임팩 리뷰,"[EDIT]
With the March 31 2022 update, the wedding functionality is vastly improved. I won't say that everything works correctly, but it is such a significant step up that I can now recommend this pack. In a wedding I trialled, my sims were married by an officiant, had their spousal kiss, cut the cake together, had rice thrown, had drinks, enjoyed toasts, had the ring bearer and sims of honour walk down the aisle - everything worked fluidly. No stress.

For some reason, throwing the bouquet did not work. My sim called and called for people to gather, and some did then became disinterested and walked away. The wedding cake needs to be placed on a dining table to be cut. Placing it on the round cake stand did not work, whereas it did previously.

Also, the check boxes for the style of outfit for the wedding couple and guests remained checked and all guests arrived in their formal outfits, as requested.

Despite some minor issues (let's face it, there are always *minor* issues) the pack is substantially functional.

[Original Review]
Having never commented previously on any other Sims 4 addon, I feel compelled to do so for this pack. The single pro is that the world is beautiful and may be one of the prettiest worlds added to the Sims 4. It is a delight.

The cons are considerable. After performing a couple of wedding ceremonies in the original game, I gave up in favour of eloping, having found the ceremonies somewhat uninteresting and poorly organised. Guest sims were never where you wanted them to be and activities surrounding the wedding poorly managed. So, I welcomed this pack with the promise of a series of connected events with a plethora of settings to support the wonderful day. Then, what a disappointment.

I won't repeat the criticisms others have made. All I will say is that we would be better off with the behaviour available in the original weddings. What we have now in the Wedding Stories Pack is a disorganised mess. I'm back to eloping.

Finally, I will ask, how did the demonstrators (pre-release) manage to cobble together a wedding that appeared to work, even though they tripped over some bugs, and decide 'yeah, good enough to release'. The weddings, which are the main reason for purchasing this pack, DO NOT WORK adequately. They are so frustrating as to take all the joy out of the event.",Recommended

The wedding went horrible, during the vows people were literally making sand castles. I set a ring bearer and the game told me there wasn't one when I clicked on the aisle.I asked the officiant to walk down the aisle and they didn't. I set a flower pal and I made her go down the aisle she didn't??

This is a really strong pack for builders / decorators as well, with a lot of great build assets and some nice furniture. The icing on this cake is the vastly improved cakes over the older cakes.

Despite being advertised as a gameplay wedding pack, I need to reiterate that weddings are NOT the strong point of this pack. The gameplay of this pack is the world - Living in or visiting a beautiful map, where you can watch lovely sunsets, play on the beach, swim in the water, and have an incredible waterfall boardwalk to jog / walk your dog.",Recommended

4208,나의 결혼이야기 게임팩 리뷰,"Let me preface this in that EA used some very SHADY marketing tactics with the release of this pack. The Russia ordeal where EA claimed it had been banned and that they couldn't alter the LGBT couple featured on the pack is a complete lie! First off it was never banned in Russia (Hence EA randomly then saying they could release it as is) and whatever real reason they had whether it be to cater to LGBT people out side of Russia to buy it, it is something that should be investigated. As an LGBT person myself I will say that even then, this dlcs pride wedding dresses and items just come off as TACKY and really show how EA as far as Sims 4 is concerned are not very innovative in game play anymore.

So No aside from the greed of EA and the shadiness surrounding this pack which (up until release day has been shown as unplayable), I still bought it because I love the Sims and there isn't anything comparable out. - As well Paralives just doesn't look even close to as good as the Sims franchise.

The map of course is beautiful and some of the build items are nice and honestly its nice to have more worlds with more lots, but other than having a good spot to build, the game pack is kind of boring. Its good if you like weddings, but heck its just another dead town with too many decorative non-functioning buildings.

4213,패션 스트리트 키트 리뷰,"Once upon a time, a junior marketing exec at EA created a Powerpoint presentation about how EA could expand their market share internationally by creating content that was actually relevant outside the US and Europe. She assumed that everyone had ignored her presentation, so she cheekily added ""international brand strategy"" to her résumé and started looking for a new job. But amazingly her boss had actually paid attention, and said ""Actually let's do this! Where did you suggest? OK, I can sell Japan to the execs as a huge market, so we can do a big expansion there, but then you also suggest... India, South Korea, Brazil... heck, I'm so insular that I couldn't even point to those places on a map, but yeah, ok, if we can get $10 for a couple of dozen bits of clothing, then the bigwigs won't care what country they are inspired by, so let's try this as an experiment and keep an eye on the data...."" And so, the Indian, Korean and Brazilian clothing packs were born...

That may not be exactly what happened, but it sure feels like it.

Now, in this pack here you have a relatively small number of clothing items, for a fairly high price.

Sounds like it should be a rip-off. It would be. Except that actually the clothing items are excellent.

Yes, I'd like more for this amount of money. But some of the women's clothing make excellent formal/party outfits, the nose ring is a great addition (why wasn't there a nose piercing in the base game?!), and the male clothing is among my most-used.

So I wanted to give this a thumbs-down for the absurd price.

But actually, it is worth a thumbs-up for the fact that it does actually look further afield for inspiration than most Sims stuff, and for the exceptional quality of the items in the pack.",Recommended

Even the color options weren't that great. The decor you get is also lacking, although what you do get is pretty nice. That's the upside of this kit, though the wallpaper designs might leave something to be desired.",Not Recommended
4278,맥시멀 데코 키트 리뷰,"I recognised the wallpapers (I've got tiger wallpaper samples around here somewhere) so I understand the price covers whatever royalties due to the designers as well as any development costs, but you really don't get much with this kit. £5 isn't a huge amount of money, but perhaps because I had high hopes for a maximalist aesthetic kit, I was disappointed with it.

My main gripe is that the wallpapers include mouldings. The coving is problematic in rooms with platforms or smaller wall heights to begin with, and it also makes it tricky to mix and match prints and/or colourways, because you have to account for different moulding colours, so I've barely used the papers that convinced me to buy the pack. The mouldings make it tricky to use the papers for feature walls, or zoned areas, too, because they are so jarring. It's a shame, because the prints and colourways are so joyful.

It would have been a nice touch to allow covings, picture rails, dado, and skirtings to be layered or coloured manually, but the wainscot panelling included in the kit shows that it isn't that simple - you can only place these panels on sections of empty walls, with no doors or windows, and you can't change colourways inside the panels. And you would if you could, wouldn't you?

The two bold tiled floorings are fun and sit well with the Moschino pack items. The few bits of furniture included in this pack are beautiful, but the scale of them can be a little strange compared with, say, base game items. There's also a medium sized Chinese-style rug, a spiky ceiling lamp and a naff peacock to play with.

There are some interesting pieces, such as the wainscoting, which I only recently noticed, although I've had it for months. When you first see it, you don't realize what it is, but it's a frame that borders each section of wall. It matches many types of paint and wallpaper, although there is only a select number of choices. I use the tiger wallpaper for male bedrooms, bathrooms, workout rooms, etc. My most recent son's room has the yellow with blue tigers wallpaper, and there are so many navy and yellow things to match with it. I have used most of the flower patterns, and although my favorite is still the spring green with dark pink flowers, there are also more muted choices, including one that is a bit bluish gray, and the flowers remind me of a night garden with blooming white flowers. There is also a dark and moody color. The patterns are very big and bold. The more geometric pattern is nice, too, and reminds me of the 1930s-1950s era. This pattern also seems to be echoed by the shelf shape in the bowling stuff pack, although I think the ""shelf"" is more of a light since I can't seem to put anything on it.

I love this kit! Just like Laundry Day, mundane tasks I am definitely procrastinating in real life are so much more fun in a game! The dust system adds an extra layer of immersion to the game... As well as, you know, a layer of dust. The aspirations related to cleaning are very fun, especially the one for being dirty which adds some real spice to the otherwise usually pristine game. Using the hand vacuum on toddlers is hilarious. The dust bunnies are adorable!

This kit gives a stronger purpose to the robot vacuums from Cats & Dogs, as they do work with the dust system to clean your floor.",Recommended

I have had no problem with too much or too fast dust build up. At least that EA seems to have fixed.

What I was not prepared for is the ridiculously overused sniffing animation. Thanks to this kit now every time your Sims change floors or go into the garden, they will pause for 5 seconds to sniff the air. Every single time! If you have a club gathering at home or visitors, they will also sniff the air. The animation plays hundreds of times in one Sim day. It gets old really really fast.

Fortunately, if you use mods, you can disable the sniffing and any other features you don't like. Modders have turned this into an enjoyable kit for me.

4314,대청소의 날 리뷰,"Don't let the other Negative Reviews fool you. It's not just the 6 Vacuum cleaners to choose from. The kit comes with an Aspiration that basically makes your lot dirty and has your sims clean it. But that's not it though. IT WORKS GREAT WITH OTHER DLC's. Here's what I've noticed in conjunction with other packs and DLC's.

University Pack: The Cleaner Ultil-Bot. If you have the chance to make one, these bots will automatically vacuum so you don't have to and saves the hassle of you buying one however, they need constant service. Then there's Servo. If you program it to clean after you download the 3rd enhancement, he will also vacuum.

Cats and Dogs: Even this Expansion Pack has it's own vacuum. The Robot Vacuum. Basically you can program it to clean your floors and I've noticed that there were no dust levels once the vacuum does it's job. Seems like the Aspiration was programmed into this vacuum also.

Vintage Glamour Stuff: The Butler also dusts the house and Vacuums automatically.

The Nanny on the base game vacuums your lot if she finds it dusty.

Don't forget to upgrade your vacs. It works faster and never breaks down.

For $4.99 USD, this is well worth it and it's fun too. Looks like the EA/Maxis staff spent alot of time into this kit.",Recommended

4321,대청소의 날 리뷰,"The pack adds the vacuum cleaners, which is reminiscent of the laundry stuff pack. Unlike the laundry stuff pack, however, a vacuum is COMPULSORY as dust can accumulate without acquiring a vacuum, which leaves the house a visible and mechanical mess. It wouldn't be so bad if the priority was right, either; I've had hungry sims get up and forget about their meal because they suddenly decided a clean room needed a once-over with the hoover.

In short:
+ Dust bunnies can be a cute mechanic
+ Clean and Dusty house perks apply on a per-floor basis, allowing diversity in perk placements
- Dust bunnies are forced on the household
- Maintaining a particular house perk is a lot of work as dust accumulates very quickly.
- Incomplete priority listing means tasks are easily overwritten.

4328,대청소의 날 리뷰,"These new Kits for Sims 4 are interesting and fun, but one in particular can use a little more polish before it becomes truly viable. I speak specifically of the Bust the Dust kit, which introduces vacuums and Dust Bunnies into the Sims 4 world.
Firstly, the dust levels seem to be far too frequent in their advancement. In my primary household (Young Adult Male, his Young Adult Female wife, and their Toddler Daughter), the Male vacuumed the downstairs before leaving for work at 8AM. When the Female (a college student) returned from class (and picking up the Toddler at daycare) around 3PM, she vacuumed the downstairs a second time in the same day. At 9PM THE SAME DAY, dust and Dust Bunnies were suddenly all over the downstairs.
Secondly, the Sims are too easily distracted by cleaning tasks. When assigning my Female college student to do her homework, she kept randomly putting down the incomplete assignment to vacuum a random object in another room. I had to sit and watch her like a hawk to keep her on task.
Finally, the “Sniff the Room” automatic action is too frequent and a little weird in its uses. The YA Male (who does NOT have the “Neat” Trait) could not seem to walk from one room to the next without sniffing the room. He would also sniff the room right before beginning any cleaning task (this was especially weird to see when he was assigned to clean out the cat’s litterbox). I finally had to uninstall the Kit to get things working like normal again (I’ve never had to take this step with ANY DLC in the Sims 4 before).
All in all, as interesting as this Kit is, it needs work yet.",Not Recommended

4335,스타워즈 바투 행성의 모험 게임팩 리뷰,"Journey to Batuu is a serious swing and miss, which is a real pity, because I was excited about SW sims pack and the idea had so much potential to be at real hit. It should have been a much more expansive pack to reward sims 4 players with proper full live in it, build in it, play in it and interact with other players in it. It fails on almost all levels and then when coming home to the main sims game, there are little to no SW functionalities left, meaning your souvenirs are mostly decorative. Sure I cluttered my backyard with it all, but still needed the main game's modernatities to fill food and hygiene needs as the batuu pack had none of that. I agree with some other reviewers, that everyone who spent money on this pack should be refunded and ea should make the pack free for everyone, seeing as this pack needs some serious work. I would at least have hoped that EA would have bothered to update and add new features to the pack to make it worth it for new players as the pack remains purchasable on steam. Great idea to add SW, but epic fail on most everything else. I would have gotten a refund, if I had not been stuck wasting all that time on Batuu, only to find out it was a complete and utter let down. Yes, you actually need to waste all that time, to be sure you did not accidentally miss anything actually cool or fun, just in case there was something worth doing there. I watched plenty of videos and read reviews and none of it prepared me for how crappy it turned out to be. I figured that as someone who likes both sims and SW it couldn't be all bad and was worth a try, sadly, it really was not. If I could have at least interactively got to build my lightsaber, got to wield it manually and built and had an independent acting pet like droid that needed no follow-me activation to follow me, that would have been something at least. Lost count of how often it was forgotten somewhere and had to be reactivated or redeployed from storage. Like many others, I was really looking forward to live and build in the pack. Who would not as it is a sims SW after all. This unfortunately really is just another vacation destination with everything ready to go and nothing much for you to do, except visit it like it was Batuu at a Disney park, but with a rebel and first order threatening in certain areas and scoundrels in the mix as neutral between the two. Also, back when I fist played, there was no toilet or shower facilities in the rebel camp nor in the first order one, so I had to try an followed where my sim ran off to sleep, alleviate itself an shower as there was nothing listed. Eventually I got the hang of taking care of the sim's needs while on batuu. At least there could have been some kind of walking into a building and finding the restroom or bed, instead of the sim disappearing into a building and the needs bar or clock showing that something was happening. So wish EA would have gotten it right and it would have been fun to play, unfortunately I found myself wasting copious amounts of time dealing with my sim's needs in the main center, instead of quickly getting through the rebel and first order missions, just so I could unlock the clothes and go home. What most players want at the end of the day is to unlock all the clothes, get the lightsaber and kyber crystal of their choice and their semi-custom built droid, so they can go home and never return. Once you have everything you could possibly purchase or unlock from Batuu, which unfortunately is not much, there really is nothing left worth doing. I only returned once or twice to see if anything had been fixed or updated and then quickly left again.",Not Recommended

It could be argued for example that people who love Star Wars would enjoy this gamepack, but even that is debatable and you also get spam requests as well for going to Batuu for anyone who buys this which usually in most cases I ignore it.

The only plus sides I have noticed is that you could replace the force you cannot use from this pack with magic from Realm of Magic despite needing to buy them as separate packs (but not allowed to use magic on Batuu apparently) and if you are bored with the limited use of lightsabers you could also try to use lightsabers with extreme violence mod for killing sims with a lightsaber. For example, I watched a youtube video a few times where I had seen Palpatine kill at least a few sims on The Sims 4 with a lightsaber perhaps with the extreme violence mod from the 9:17 minute video called ""Sims 4 A Star Wars Story"".

This add on is not a full length S.W story line nor is it as in depth as the main Sims 4 game. It is an add on which means small in terms of missions, experience and game play.

Don't expect something grand because you will be disappointed. Expect something fun and neat as a small piece of the S.W legacy and you will be contented.

-The Lightsaber duel was fun.
-The only vacation that grants you money (credits), so far.
-Traveling to Batuu didn't use any cash
-New learnable foods and drinks on Batuu, although they're relatively expensive when you make it on earth.
-Despite on rabbit hole, I think the Dwelling has the most efficient way to fulfill sims need (bladder, shower, sleep), it's faster to fiiled. You can sleep at 12 am and then wake up at 3.30 am with positive moodlet.
-New clothes & hair style

Cons
-The game is overpriced
-All aliens just 'human' with masks, no kinda alien power either (like aliens in GettoWork)
-STILL BUGGY. For example when I escorted the resistance to TIE plane they just freeze with no reason and I can't complete the task!

I will complete all of the objectives and then it just doesn't close out the mission and the only way you can end it is by quitting, which means you don't get any of the benefits from the mission. This wouldn't be so bad if you could have several missions open at a time, but you can only have one, so instead you'll be stuck doing a mission without getting anything out of it or even being able to advance to higher level missions. As a result, the Batuu part of the DLC (the bulk of it really) is borderline unplayable and breaks a number of promises that this DLC makes (you can't get a lightsaber or a droid unless you have the Batuu currency, but you can't get any money without completing missions).

4370,스타워즈 바투 행성의 모험 게임팩 리뷰,I mostly like it for the music and the lightsabers. The rest of the content (what there is of it) is kinda meh. Know what you're getting and buy it on sale.,Recommended
4371,스타워즈 바투 행성의 모험 게임팩 리뷰,"Okay, I'm giving this the thumbs up, but with some GIANT caveats. First off, obviously this doesn't smoothly fit into the rest of your Sims experience. It's the new Star Wars stuff only, which is not what most people prefer. Most of your usual 'taking care of status bars' is trivialized by a rabbit hole your sims pop into briefly that tops off most bars. All supernatural life state abilities are suppressed while in Batuu. All of your normal inventory is inaccessible while in Batuu (it's just hidden, it's all returned and just fine when you go back to your normal Sim lives). There are no new skills - While the base skills are widely used, and used well, it *is* disappointing that lightsabers are just plain old fitness. Aaaaand you do not have any sort of house you stay in while in Batuu (the ""residence"" is a rabbit hole and not exactly *yours*), you're kinda a cantina hobo.

All of that said! Actually the little missions you do are pretty unique. Very simple for the most part, but I had a lot of fun with them. It is very easy to get engaged in running your Sims around on the missions, and there are a lot of neat little trophies and toys that they can take home out of the experience. There's enough depth in the content that your Sims can spend weeks there before running out and needing to just repeat things on end. I also actually really enjoy the outfits from this. They do a great job of being Star Wars while you're in Batuu, but for the rest of the game they add some clothing that is VERY different from the other stuff available.

Compared to other Game Packs, I do still rate this as a very low priority. While it is fun, it adds a rather minimal amount to your otherwise and overall Sims experience. However I can also give this one an aside - If you happen to be into both Sims and Star Wars, this pack can stand alone very well (I mean, it shuts out most of the rest of the game by force, so you're mostly playing just Batuu content when you're in it!), so getting it fairly early before most packs would not be a waste.",Recommended

Hondo was exactly as i remember him, kylo was pretty meh and rey's was weird to me. simlish with a british accent is something i now know exists and is something i now hate. all you do is go around and do missions for the 3 factions. some can be cool but most of them are pretty underwhelming. i can 100% see why people despise this game pack but like i said, i had fun. don't buy this if you're not into star wars. i wish they did more with this. but hey, disney and EA are two big greedy companies so what can you do?",Recommended

I have never reviewed any of the other packs or the main game itself but it was so boring, frustrating, repetitive and misleading that i felt the need to warn others from buying it. Steer clear, you don't need it, there's nothing you can do there that helps in the main game, you talk to people, get missions which is go talk to people, open some boxes, talk to people. You can't own homes there, you cannot rent a specific house for yourself you just click on the residence and they go inside (you cannot see inside) to sleep, shower, go to the toilet etc.

For what ever reason if I leave my First Order Aligned Sim alone with my First Order droid, she only praises the rebels and scolds the droid, causing it to shock her (which empties your energy bar to 0 every time.)

The furniture and clothing that this pack adds are pretty good all around (though, again, there should be more of them), and Batuu is fun to walk and play around in for a bit.

4388,스타워즈 바투 행성의 모험 게임팩 리뷰,"The Sims 4 Journey to Batuu is a Star Wars game pack expansion that lets you journey to what is essentially The Disney Land Star Wars Attraction. Batuu is not a new location like the smaller town included with Realms of Magic, but a vacation destination that includes three locations within Batuu that has a location for the Resistance forest, Black Rock Isle for the Scoundrels, and The First Order area. The Game Pack then has you explore Batuu and eventually team up with either the resistance or the first order with the option of doing side missions for the scoundrels regardless of what side you choose. These missions range will include walking to one area and talking to someone about the secret resistance base, or splicing into terminals with dataspikes to find door codes to access an enemy base, or even taking the Millennium Falcon for a ""Business Trip"" with Hondo and Chewy. Eventually you can even get your own lightsaber and choose which kyber crystal you want to use and you also can pay someone to build a droid for you which will help you out with certain types of missions and also be a little companion you can chat too. A handfull of added clothing and accessories options let you dress up in Star Wars apparel and even disguise yourself as a twielk and other star wars races. Other than a few new food and drink options this is where the fun ends for me.

The game is more of what makes the Sims 4 repetitive and stale: uninspired, bland gameplay and environments. EA could have made something cool here, but they opted for the easy route. The missions for each faction are all the same, either you walk to someone and ask a couple questions or you're clicking through menu options while you're character is off screen in a space mission having fun. Their are no added skills; Lightsabers use you're fitness skill to judge just how competent you are at wielding an elegant for a more civilized age and a lack of force powers, even just small ones like force heal for a happiness boost or force push to knock someone on their butts, is sad and would make the immersion of being ""in star wars"" worth the 20 dollar price alone if it was included. The textures in the game are more of the fairly low res stuff that were used too that makes zooming in and looking a buildings something i would advise against.

Overall I would say unless you're getting restless in your house and you really wanna go to a Disney Land Attraction during Covid I would avoid this till its on sale. EA needs to have a honest talk with themselves about the future of this franchise. I know they have their ""whales"", I know cause i was one for the sims 2, but the monetization is getting out of control. I feel like EA should take the same route Elder Scrolls Online has. Makes previous expansions free as part of the base game, sell the newest one for forty like you are, and then you can still sell your game and stuff packs for the people who need everything. It just seems like a simple solution that would both make older fans happy that the base game isnt empty and inspire more people to invest in your game and the community. Thus creating more fans for whatever you release next.

So, with my bias in mind, I'm still completely blown away by how LITTLE is present in this star wars expansion. It's astonishing, and I'm really impressed it has some good reviews. There's so, so, SO little to do. It's an insanely watered-down version of the World Adventures expansion pack in Sims 3, with a star-wars theme.

I really didn't need to think about that in my life time. EVER. JUST NO. Next, The buildings aren't actually functioning buildings. They are just the external facade and you click on them to complete an action, but you can't actually explore. THATS JUST IT, THERE IS NO EXPLORATION.

The awesome thing is that the droids would follow you around and can play music while you're at it. The droids also have their own social meter so you can eventually be friends with it. =)


Another great thing about this DLC is it allows you to craft your own light saber. You can do missions to earn the kyber crystals and hilt for it, or if you have the credits, buy them from a store. Either way would allow you to have light saber sparring missions which are enjoying to watch.




Surprisingly this DLC is fun. The world is well crafted and it feels compelling like you're on a whole Star Wars game on its own completely separate from the Sims.
